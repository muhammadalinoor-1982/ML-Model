Foxa1 and Foxa2 are expressed during prostate budding and ductal morphogenesis, while Foxa1 expression is retained in adult prostate epithelium. Previous characterization of prostatic tissue rescued from embryonic Foxa1 knockout mice revealed Foxa1 to be essential for ductal morphogenesis and epithelial maturation. However, it is unknown whether Foxa1 is required to maintain the differentiated status in adult prostate epithelium. Here, we employed the PBCre4 transgenic system and determined the impact of prostate-specific Foxa1 deletion in adult murine epithelium. PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mouse prostates showed progressive florid hyperplasia with extensive cribriform patterning, with the anterior prostate being most affected. Immunohistochemistry studies show mosaic Foxa1 KO consistent with PBCre4 activity, with Foxa1 KO epithelial cells specifically exhibiting altered cell morphology, increased proliferation, and elevated expression of basal cell markers. Castration studies showed that while PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp prostates did not exhibit altered sensitivity in response to hormone ablation compared with control prostates, the number of Foxa1 positive cells in mosaic Foxa1 KO prostates were significantly reduced compared to Foxa1 negative cells following castration. Unexpectedly, gene expression profile analyses revealed that Foxa1 deletion caused abnormal expression of seminal vesicle associated genes in KO prostates. In summary, these results indicate Foxa1 expression is required for the maintenance of prostatic cellular differentiation.  Keywords: Androgen, AR, castration, prostate, prostate cancer, prostate-specific, FOXA The Forkhead Box (Fox in mice, FOX in human) family of transcription factors consists of 43 proteins, which are organized into 19 subfamilies based on amino acid sequence conservation (1). Foxa1 (originally termed hepatocyte nuclear factor one alpha; HNF1\\u03b1) was originally discovered in mammals as a transcription factor in the liver (2). Importantly, the structure of the DNA binding domain of Foxa proteins contains a variant of the helix-loop-helix motif, giving it the appearance of a \\u201cwinged helix.\\u201d This structure closely resembles that of a linker histone (3), and enables Foxa1 to directly influence chromatin structure. In addition, the C-terminus of Foxa1 binds to core histones and is required for chromatin opening in vitro (4). For these reasons, Foxa proteins make DNA sequences accessible for the binding of additional transcriptional activators and/or repressors, and have accordingly been described as \\u201cpioneer factors.\\u201d The \\u201cpioneering\\u201d function of Foxa proteins has led to the suggestion that these proteins enable cells to respond quickly to changes in their environment by altering transcriptional regulation of genes. The ability of Foxa transcription factors to impart \\u201ccompetence\\u201d for the rapid initiation of gene expression has been suggested as central to their function. In addition, the observation that Fox family members are retained on mitotic chromosomes (5, 6), suggests an important role for Foxa1 in the maintenance of cell fate.  Foxa1 and Foxa2 expression is restricted to the epithelial compartment during embryonic prostate development (7). While Foxa2 expression is extinguished following budding morphogenesis, Foxa1 expression is maintained in the adult prostate epithelium. Our laboratory previously showed that Foxa1 expression is required for normal prostate organogenesis (8, 9). In fact, expression of Foxa proteins play an essential role during the development of several organs, and Foxa1 and Foxa2 have been shown to act in a cooperative manner during the normal development of the liver, lungs, dopaminergic neurons and pancreas (10). Our laboratory was the first to report the direct physical interaction of Foxa1 with the androgen receptor (AR), and the importance of Foxa1 expression for the regulation of prostate-specific gene expression (11). While altered levels of Foxa1 and Foxa2 expression have been implicated in prostate cancer (12\\u201317), the importance of Foxa1 expression in the adult, non-neoplastic prostate is unknown. Therefore, we undertook this study to determine the impact of prostate-specific genetic ablation of Foxa1in adult mice.  Go to: Materials and Methods Mouse lines and breeding  Foxa1loxp mice have been previously described (18). PBCre4 (19) activity was detected 14 days after birth, and increases with rising testicular androgen production and the onset of sexual maturity in mice. PBCre4 has been previously reported to result in prostate-specific Cre recombinase activity, and Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, MA) express red fluorescence prior to, and green fluorescence following Cre-mediated recombination (20). To identify specific cell populations targeted by Cre-mediated recombination in the PBCre4 mouse line, PBCre4 mice were bred with Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J, resulting in PBCre4/Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J mice (hereafter designated PBCre4/Tomato mice). Prostate-specific Foxa1 knockout was achieved by breeding PBCre4 mice to Foxa1loxp and Foxa1loxp/loxp mice, resulting in PBCre4/Foxa1loxp and PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice, respectively. PBCre4/Foxa1loxp and PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice were aged up to 40 weeks. Following sacrifice, individual prostate lobes, seminal vesicle and bladders were dissected, formalin fixed and processed for paraffin embedding according to standard procedures.  Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence  Slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols and washed in double deionized water for 5 minutes. Tissues were then placed in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving samples for 20 minutes at 30% power in a 900 W microwave oven. Slides were then cooled to room temperature, and then washed 3 times for 10 minutes in PBS (pH 7.4). For immunohistochemistry, all incubations were performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with the use of Peroxidase blocking reagent (Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA) for 20 minutes, after which sections were again washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes. Prepared slides were incubated in horse serum for 30 min to reduce non-specific antibody binding. Slides where then incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody. After 3 10 min washes in PBS, slides were then incubated overnight in the presence of primary antibody. On the following day, slides were then washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS and biotinylated secondary antibody diluted in PBS was then added. Primary antibody was visualized using the Vectastain Elite ABC Peroxidase kit (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol with DAB in substrate buffer as chromogen (Thermo Scientific, Fremont CA). For immunofluorescence studies, the above described procedure was followed on the first day, but after washing in PBS, slides were incubated for 1 hr in the dark with secondary antibody (1:1000 in blocking solution). Following PBS wash, slides were mounted in DAPI cotaining Vector medium. Primary antibodies used included Krt 8/18, Krt 14 (Dako), Foxa1, AR, GFP, p63 (Santa Cruz) (8,21,22), and Foxc1 (Sigma; http://www.proteinatlas.org/). Ki67 staining was performed by the Vanderbilt Experimental Pathology Core, as previously reported (8). Slides were visualized on a Zeiss Axio Imager.M1 microscope with Axiovision image capture software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood NY).  Quantitative RT-PCR  RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was conducted using SuperScriptII from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was performed on iCycler using iQ SYBR Green Supermix from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). PCR was performed as follows: 95 \\u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \\u00b0C/30 s, 58 \\u00b0C/30 s and 72 \\u00b0C/30s. All samples were normalized to GAPDH. Results were expressed as fold change of each sample versus control using the 2(\\u2212\\u0394\\u0394Ct) method (23). Primer sequences used in this study are as follows: Foxc1 (CCAATGCTTCCTTAAGCGGC, TGGCTAAGGCGGCCAAATAA); Svs3b (GGATGTGCTACTGTCCAAGAG, TGCAAGGTGTTAAGGACTACAGG); Svs6 (CCACCAGCTTCTTTCTCCTTACA, CCCATCTTCACCATTGACCAT); Fam3b (AAGGGCTTTGAGCTCCCTTC, CCTTCGATCTGGATCTCCGC); Trpv6 (ACCAGCCTTCCACCCCAT, TCAGAGCCTGGACATCGTTT); Prom2 (CGGGCTGGAGAAAATCCACT, GCTTCGAAGTTCTCTGGCCT) Usp18 (GACAGTCGACAGAAAGCCGT, CAAATCAGGGACTCCTGCGT).  Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation  Co-immunoprecipitation of both endogenously expressed Foxc1 and transiently overexpressed Foxc1 with AR were performed, using the prostate myofibroblast cell line WPMY-AR, which was previously engineered to stably overexpress AR (24). Transient transfection of WPMY-AR cells with Foxc1 expression plasmid was performed using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer recommendation, and essentially as previously reported (25). Transfected WPMY-AR cells expressing Foxc1 were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml of nondenaturing lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1X concentration of complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Nutley, NJ). After sonication, centrifugation, and pre-clearing, 1 mg of total cell lysate for each reaction was incubated at 4 C overnight with 20 \\u03bcl (dry volume) protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), which were conjugated with 1 \\u03bcg experimental antibody or IgG antibody. Following overnight incubation, samples were centrifuged and the pelleted protein G-Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with PBS followed by protein dissociation and Western blotting analysis. The affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (HPA040670, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to immunoprecipitate Foxc1. Western blotting to identify interactions between Foxc1 and AR were subsequently performed with anti-AR (N20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). IgG was used as a negative control.  Microarray analysis  Microarray analysis on RNA extracted from anterior prostates (AP) dissected from control and experimental mice, as well as the seminal vesicles dissected from control mice was performed using the GeneTitan1.1.ST mouse array (Affymetrix Corp; Santa Clara, CA) by the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE) core. The GeneTitan1.1.ST mouse array chip contains probes for 26,166 coding transcripts (RefSeq), and approximately 7,000 non-coding transcripts, including 2,000 long intergenic non-coding transcripts. Instrument control and data acquisition was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console. Fold change was calculated in a log base 2 space, using the following formula (Fold Change = 2^(experimental \\u2212 control)), followed by inverting and negating ratios less than 1. Microarray analysis was performed both to identify increases in seminal vesical associated gene expression in the AP of Foxa1 KO mice, as well as to identify genes whose expression was altered coordinately following both castration and Foxa1 KO. See supplementary data for gene lists.  Go to: Results Foxa1 expression is restricted to luminal epithelium; a subpopulation of cells which are efficiently targeted by PBCre4  As FOXA1 expression in the human prostate is restricted to luminal epithelium, while basal prostate epithelium fails to exhibit positive FOXA1 immunostaining (26), we performed dual immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the extent of Foxa1 colocalization with cytokeratin (Krt) 8/18 and Krt14, which are markers of luminal and basal epithelium, respectively (Figure 1). We performed this staining on the anterior prostates (AP), as this lobe of the murine prostate has the largest population of Krt14 positive basal cells. As is the case in humans (26), results show that Foxa1 expression is restricted to Krt 8/18 positive epithelium (Figure 1D, inset) in the adult mouse, and is not detected in the Krt14 positive basal cell layer (Figure 1H, inset). Promoters vary in their penetrance, which is the primary determinant in their ability to efficiently drive transgene expression in specific cell types. Therefore, selecting the proper promoter to drive Cre recombinase is essential. Initial immunofluorescence studies required that we utilize a promoter specifically expressed in luminal epithelium to achieve genetic ablation of Foxa1 in the prostate. In order to verify the suitability of the PBCre4 transgenic line for the targeting of Foxa1 positive luminal prostate epithelium, we bred PBCre4 mice to the Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J reporter line (Figure 2). Dual immunofluorescence studies (2A; DAPI, 2B; Foxa1, 2C; GFP, 2D Merge) on the AP of an adult mouse revealed that PBCre4 targeted a subset of cytokeratin-8/18 positive luminal epithelium (Figure 2C). A range of GFP positive cells in which Cre was activated was detected in the anterior prostate (AP), with the distal tips and base of the AP being the most affected. A similar range of GFP positive cells in the lateral (LP), dorsal (DP) and ventral (VP) prostates were GFP positive (see supplementary data). Dual immunofluorescence for GFP and Foxa1 revealed that Foxa1 positive murine prostate epithelium was efficiently targeted by Cre recombinase (Figure 2D) in the adult AP. In summary, these data suggest PBCre4 is suitable to achieve conditional Foxa1 knockout in the murine prostatic luminal cells.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Foxa1 expression in murine prostate epithelium co-localizes with cytokeratin 8/18 expression, but is absent in cytokeratin 14 positive basal prostate epithelium Figure 2 Figure 2 PBCre4 efficiently targets Foxa1 positive prostate epithelium Prostate-specific mosaic Foxa1 knockout results in florid hyperplasia  To determine the impact of Foxa1 ablation on tissue morphology, PBCre4/Foxa1loxp and PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice (and control Foxa1loxp and Foxa1loxp/loxp mice) were aged and sacrificed at 7, 24, and 33 weeks of age. Histological analysis (Figure 3; top panel Foxa1loxp/loxp control mice; bottom panel PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice) showed changes as early as 7 weeks of age in the AP and DP, which progressed to florid hyperplasia complete with cribriform patterning (Figure 3; bottom panel). Progressive hyperplasia was present in all lobes by 24 weeks. We did not observe epithelial cell invasion into the prostatic stroma. In keeping with PBCre4/Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J cre mapping studies, Foxa1 knockout was mosaic in nature in all lobes of the prostate (Figure 4; top left). Ki67 staining revealed a increase in the number of proliferating cells (Figure 4; top right), with the largest proportion of Ki67 staining present in the AP and DP (Figure 4; bottom panel; D is depiction of AP). We previously reported that FOXA1 loss coincided with increased Ki67 staining in human bladder cancer specimens, suggesting that Foxa1 negative murine prostate epithelium would be Ki67 positive (21). However, this did not appear to be the case, as increases in Ki67 labeling were not restricted to Foxa1 negative cells as shown by dual immunofluorescence of the AP dissected from 24 week-old PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice (Figure 4; bottom panel; D). These results indicate PBCre4-mediated Foxa1 knockout increases the proliferation of prostate epithelium in a manner that is not simply restricted to Foxa1 knockout epithelium.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Prostates dissected from PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice exhibit progressive hyperplasia with cribriform patterning Figure 4 Figure 4 PBCre4-mediated Foxa1 knockout is mosaic in nature, and results in increased epithelial proliferation PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice exhibit altered localization of p63 positive basal cells  Embryonic Foxa1 knockout was previously reported to result in an expansion of the basal cell population (8). Immunohistochemistry for p63 in 24 week old PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice revealed a similar increase in the number of basal epithelial cells (Figure 5, A). In addition to being expanded, the p63 positive cell population was not limited to the basal compartment of the epithelium (see PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp Figure 5A). We performed dual immunofluorescence on the AP of 24 week old PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice to determine if cells with PBCre4-mediated recombination and Foxa1 knockout were also activating p63 expression. Dual immunofluorescence clearly showed p63 is not expressed in Foxa1-null luminal epithelium (Figure 5B). Increases in p63 could also be mediated by an expansion of the intermediate cell population, indicating a failure of Foxa1 negative cells to fully differentiate. Dual immunofluorescence of 24 week old PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice demonstrated that Krt8/18 and p63 expression were mutually exclusive in the AP, indicating the lack of an expanding intermediary cell population in response to Foxa1 knockout (Figure 5C).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Foxa1 knockout results in a non-cell autonomous expansion of p63 positive basal epithelium While Foxa1 knockout prostates retain androgen sensitivity, Foxa1 positive cells appear more sensitive to castration  Examination of the weights of anterior prostates dissected from the intact Foxa1loxp/loxp and PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice revealed significant differences (p=0.013), which may be attributed to decreased secretory activity of Foxa1 KO prostates (8). PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice retain AR expression (see supplementary data), but it was unclear how Foxa1 knockout would influence prostate regression following castration. We therefore examined the prostates of 33 week old PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice and control Foxa1loxp and Foxa1loxp/loxp mice 2 weeks after castration. Both Foxa1loxp/loxp and PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice showed prostatic atrophy after castration, as indicated by significant decreases in prostate weight (Figure 6A; Student\\u2019s t test; p<0.0005), decreased Ki67 immuno positivity, as well as histological alterations (regression of glandular structure, increased expansion of smooth muscle, and altered nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio; data not shown). Comparison of tissue dissected from intact and castrated 33 week-old PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice revealed a significant decrease in the number of Foxa1 positive cells following castration. (Figure 6C; Mann-Whitney test; p=0.0003). No significant changes in Foxa1 immunostaining were detected in the following the comparison of intact and castrated tissue dissected from 33 week-old Foxa1loxp/loxp mice (Figure 6C; Mann-Whitney test; p=0.7). These results potentially indicate that in the subpopulation of prostate luminal epithelium not targeted by PBCre4, and therefore retain Foxa1, are especially sensitive to androgen deprivation while the Foxa1-null cells are more resistant to castration.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Castration increases the number of Foxa1-negative prostate epithelial cells in PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice PBCre4-Foxa1 KO prostates express markers of seminal vesicle differentiation  We performed microarray analysis to gain further insights into changes in gene expression following Foxa1 knockout. Microarray analysis on the Foxa1 KO AP dissected from a 33 week-old mouse, as well as age-matched controls revealed that three of the six major Seminal Vesicle Secretions (SVS) genes were up regulated in this lobe of the murine prostate. Therefore, microarray analysis was performed on the seminal vesicles and a comparison of genes expressed in intact seminal vesicles was made to the Foxa1 KO AP. This analysis revealed that 57 genes normally specific to the seminal vesicles were now expressed by the Foxa1 KO AP (see supplementary data for gene list). Because Foxa1 activity is so intricately tied to AR function in the prostate, Foxa1 KO could alter pathways that are associated with response to circulating androgens. Therefore, we performed microarray analysis to identify the number of genes (if any) that were coordinately regulated by both castration and Foxa1 KO (see supplementary data). This analysis revealed of 240 genes whose expression decreased in response to castration, 47 (19.6%) of the same genes changed following Foxa1 KO. Of 271 genes whose expression increased following castration of a control prostate, 30 (11.1%) of the same genes changed following Foxa1 KO.  In regard to the increased expression of genes associated with seminal vesicle, qRT-PCR and subsequent statistical analysis of cDNA samples prepared from AP dissected from 33 week-old Foxa1loxp/loxp mice and aged-matched PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice revealed significant increases (Student\\u2019s t test) in the expression of Foxc1, as well as the seminal vesicle marker genes Svs3b and Svs6 (Figure 7A;). In addition, we were able to detect significant increases in the expression of Fam3b, Trpv6, and Prom2, all of which are normally expressed in a relatively seminal vesicle-specific manner (Figure 7A). Immunohistochemistry of murine seminal vesicle showed that Foxc1 is expressed at high levels in this androgen target tissue (Figure 7B; left panel). Furthermore, while we failed to detect Foxc1 expression in AP prostates dissected from 40 week-old Foxa1loxp/loxp (Figure 7B; middle panel), we detected increased Foxc1 expression in AP epithelial cells dissected from age-matched PBCre4/Foxa1loxp/loxp mice (Figure 7B; right panel). Since we have previously shown that Foxa1 interacts with the AR in human prostate epithelial cells, we postulated that Foxc1 may also physically interact with AR in tissues where these transcription factors are co-expressed. To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on cells expressing both AR and Foxc1. The WPMY-AR cell line, which are a myofibroblastic cell line engineered to stably overexpress AR (24), was chosen because Foxc1 expression was previously reported to be increased in prostatic stroma (27). Immunoprecipitation of Foxc1, followed by western blotting analysis, showed that AR co-precipitated indicating a physical interaction with endogenously expressed Foxc1 in WPMY-AR cells (Figure 7C). Our ability to detect this interaction was enhanced following overexpression of Foxc1 in WPMY-AR cells (Figure 7D). These results indicate Foxc1 interacts with AR, and that this complex may be important in the regulation of AR target genes in Foxa1-negative cells.  Figure 7 Figure 7 PBCre4-mediated Foxa1 knockout results in the increased expression of the novel AR-interacting protein Foxc1 and additional seminal vesicle-associated genes Go to: Discussion We had previously reported an essential role for Foxa1 expression during normal prostate development (8), where knockout of Foxa1 during embryonic development resulted in the failure of prostate morphogenesis, an expansion of a p63 positive basal cell population, and the retention of embryonic markers of prostate development, including Foxa2. However, embryonic knockout of Foxa1 made it impossible to determine the importance of this transcription factor for the maintenance of normal prostatic differentiation that occurs with sexual maturation. In the current study, we used the PBCre4 system to ablate Foxa1 in a prostate-specific manner during sexual maturation. We show that the PBCre4 efficiently targets the luminal prostate epithelium that expresses Foxa1 (See Figures 1 & 2, as well as supplementary data), and that PBCre4-mediated Foxa1 knockout results in progressive and florid hyperplasia with cribriform patterning, which is most pronounced in the AP (See Figure 3). These studies revealed an important role for Foxa1 expression in the adult prostate for the maintenance of a differentiated phenotype.  PBCre4 targets luminal prostate epithelium, resulting in a \\u201cmosaic\\u201d knockout of Foxa1. This phenomenon revealed differences in the relative androgen sensitivity of Foxa1 positive and negative cells. These results indicate that Foxa1 positive cells are more sensitive to castration (or that Foxa1 negative cells are more resistant to castration), enabling a relative expansion of the Foxa1 negative epithelial cell population (Figure 6). It is impossible to know if these results are a direct influence of decreased AR action on the epithelial cell compartment (which is now heterogenous in regard to Foxa1 expression), or if they are a reflection of differences in which FOXA1 positive and negative epithelium responds to androgen-regulated paracrine signals from the stroma (28). Put differently, in the epithelium our observation may be the result of the physical interaction between Foxa1 and AR, as well as the fact that these transcription factors act in a cooperative manner to regulate gene expression in response to paracrine stromal signals. Further studies are planned to identify the exact mechanism by which Foxa1 status influences sensitivity to androgens. It is also interesting to note that PBCre4 induced recombination in the majority of prostate epithelium as revealed by our reporter mouse studies (see Figure 2 and supplementary data), which would predict a more complete knockout of Foxa1 then was revealed in our studies (see Figure 4). This apparent discrepancy may indicate that Foxa1 knockout is initially toxic in a subset of prostate epithelium, while additional populations in which Foxa1 is successfully ablated survive this genetic change. Nonetheless, Foxa1 ablation with the PBCre4 did result in a striking phenotype (see Figure 3). Further study is required to determine the short-term impact of Foxa1 knockout.  AR expression is widely distributed among tissues derived from the developing germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm); yet, precise genes associated with differentiation are regulated by AR in specific cell populations (29). The cell-specific expression of AR target genes is explained via the combinational control of gene expression model. This paradigm predicts that the presence and activity of a unique combination of different regulatory proteins during development and in adult tissues dictates cell fate (29, 30). The family of forkhead proteins is particularly interesting since their expression is temporally restricted during development and specific to adult cell populations. We reported that the AR and Foxa1 protein formed a complex via their DNA binding domains on multiple prostate specific genes and that this complex is critical for differentiation of the prostate gland (8, 9, 11). It is now widely recognized that the AR/FOXA1 complex is fundamental in androgen action in the prostate and the function of FOXA1 has been extended to include estrogen receptor action in human breast (31). Recently, ChIP-Seq experiments on the glucocorticoid receptor showed that binding sites for this steroid receptor were enriched for forkhead binding sites\\u2014the precise forkhead remain unidentified (32). Here we report that the conditional knock out of Foxa1 in the adult mouse prostate results in the loss of prostate-specific gene expression and the gain of at least 57 genes normally expressed in the seminal vesicle. Within this group of genes, we see expression of the androgen regulated seminal vesicle secretion (SVS) genes. SVS2 is expressed in both the prostate and seminal vesicles (33, 34) but SVSI and SVS3, SVS4, SVS5, and SVS6 are major androgen regulated secretory proteins specific to the seminal vesicles (35). In keeping with this observation, we discovered that Foxa1 KO resulted in the increased expression of Nr4a3 and Foxc1 (see supplementary data), both of which are associated with mesodermal development (36, 37). This switch of gene expression demonstrates that the prostate, which originates from endoderm, can be reprogrammed by the loss of Foxa1 to express androgen target gene that are specific to the seminal vesicle, which originates from mesoderm. This reprogramming is consistent with other studies which have demonstrated that not all AR binding sites depend upon FOXA1 binding, and in fact, loss of FOXA1 can reprogram AR to bind alternative promoters, and result in expression of AR-regulated genes that are normally repressed in the presence of FOXA1 (38). In the mouse prostate, loss of FOXA1 appears to mediate the expression of seminal vesicle genes.  In order to determine possible alternative forkhead binding partners for AR, we looked both in our microarray analysis of the PB-Foxa1 mouse and the literature. Foxc1 was the most up regulated forkhead family member by microarray analysis, and analysis of Fox family members in prostate cancer cell lines had previously revealed that FOXA1 and FOXC1 where inversely expressed in androgen-dependent and independent cell lines (27). Although Foxa1 expression is largely restricted to endoderm, Foxa1 is detected in some mesodermally and ectodermally derived tissues (39, 40). However, IHC staining of the seminal vesicle shows that the epithelial cells are Foxa1 negative but Foxc1 positive. Also, IHC staining of the prostate shows that the control prostates are Foxc1 negative but the conditional knock out of Foxa1 results in expression of Foxc1 in the prostate epithelium. Further, we demonstrate that the AR and Foxc1 can directly interact suggesting that an AR/Foxc1 complex is important in androgen action in the seminal vesicle. Unfortunately, no seminal vesicle cell lines have been developed that would allow us to confirm the AR/Foxc1 complex regulates seminal vesicle genes that are enriched following Foxa1 knockout. However, it is interesting to note that approximately 40% of primary prostate tumors are FOXA1 negative, and these negative prostate tumors exhibit relatively indolent behavior (41). It would be interesting to determine the extent to which FOXC1 and seminal vesicle-related genes are upregulated in this tumor cohort, as well as the ramifications of these potential gene expression changes in regard to tumor biology.  Forkhead transcription factors are grouped into subfamilies (such as the Foxa subfamily) based on the extent of sequence conservation within the DNA binding domain. Of the 43 forkhead proteins, Foxb1, Foxb2, and Foxc1 have the next most conserved DNA binding motifs to Foxa1 (1). Taken together, this suggests a model where some of the organ-specific target genes induced by the AR can, in part, be due to specific complexes between this receptor and a forkhead protein. Likely, this model would apply to other steroid receptors that would partner with specific forkhead proteins to control steroid receptor action in multiple organs.\",\n          \"The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) cascade plays crucial roles in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and survival. Accumulating evidence suggests that in some tumor types, FGFRs are bona fide oncogenes to which cancer cells are addicted. Because FGFR inhibition can reduce proliferation and induce cell death in a variety of in vitro and in vivo tumor models harboring FGFR aberrations, a growing number of research groups have selected FGFRs as targets for anticancer drug development. Multikinase FGFR/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors have shown promising activity in breast cancer patients with FGFR1 and/or FGF3 amplification. Early clinical trials with selective FGFR inhibitors, which may overcome the toxicity constraints raised by multitarget kinase inhibition, are recruiting patients with known FGFR(1\\u20134) status based on genomic screens. Preliminary signs of antitumor activity have been demonstrated in some tumor types, including squamous cell lung carcinomas. Rational combination of targeted therapies is expected to further increase the efficacy of selective FGFR inhibitors. Herein, we discuss unsolved questions in the clinical development of these agents and suggest guidelines for management of hyperphosphatemia, a class-specific mechanism-based toxicity. In addition, we propose standardized definitions for FGFR1 and FGFR2 gene amplification based on in situ hybridization methods. Extended access to next-generation sequencing platforms will facilitate the identification of diseases in which somatic FGFR(1\\u20134) mutations, amplifications and fusions are potentially driving cancer cell viability, further strengthening the role of FGFR signaling in cancer biology and providing more possibilities for the therapeutic application of FGFR inhibitors.  Keywords: fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR, amplification, cancer, hyperphosphatemia, oncogene, targeted therapy Go to: introduction Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling plays crucial roles in cancer cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and survival. The FGFR pathway was primarily studied in cancer as a direct promoter of endothelial cell proliferation and tumor neoangiogenesis, having complementary and synergistic effects with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling [1, 2]. Recent studies have uncovered increasing evidence that in addition to its role as an escape mechanism of anti-VEGF therapies, deregulated FGFRs can function as driving oncogenes in certain tumor types, acting in a cell autonomous fashion to maintain the malignant properties of cancer cells [2, 3]. When FGFRs are mutated or amplified, aberrant activation of downstream pathways results in mitogenic, mesenchymal, and antiapoptotic responses in cells. The combination of knockdown studies and selective pharmacological inhibition in preclinical models confirms that FGFRs are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer [2]. In this article, we will focus on the main FGFR genomic alterations found in human cancer to date, how they may contribute to specific tumor types, describe the range of treatment strategies currently employed or in development to inhibit deregulated FGFRs and discuss unsolved questions in the clinical development of these agents.  Go to: FGFR pathway The FGFR family includes four receptor tyrosine kinases FGFR(1\\u20134) comprised of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular portion contains three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) folds (IgI, IgII, and IgIII) with a stretch of eight consecutive acidic residues between IgI and IgII (the acidic box). While the IgII and IgIII domains are necessary and sufficient for ligand binding, the amino-terminal portion of the receptor containing IgI and the acidic box has an auto-inhibitory function. Alternative splicing of the IgIII extracellular fragment of FGFR1, 2, or 3 may generate isoforms that differ in terms of ligand-binding specificity, with IgIIIb and IgIIIc specifically expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme, respectively. The intracellular region of FGFRs contains a juxta-membrane domain, a split kinase domain with the classical tyrosine kinase motifs, and a carboxy-terminal tail [4].  Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are secreted glycoproteins that are readily sequestered by the extracellular matrix and the cell surface by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HPSGs). Cell-surface HPSGs stabilize the FGF ligand\\u2013receptor interaction by protecting FGFs from protease-mediated degradation [2]. In the case of hormone-like FGFs (FGF19, 21, and 23), the FGF\\u2013FGFR interaction requires a cell surface co-receptor, klotho or \\u03b2-klotho, for high-affinity binding and signaling. Upon ligand binding, FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) functions as a key adaptor protein that associates with the receptor and initiates downstream signaling with activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. FGFR signaling also couples to phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-\\u03b3) in an FRS2-independent manner and stimulates protein kinase C (PKC), which partly reinforces the MAPK pathway activation by phosphorylating RAF. Depending on the cellular context, several other pathways are also activated by FGFRs including the p38 MAPK and Jun N-terminal kinase pathways, signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) [2, 4, 5].  The mechanisms of attenuation and negative feedback control of FGFR signaling are poorly understood and are likely to vary depending on the cell type. Downstream signaling can be attenuated through the induction of MAPK phosphatases (MAPK3), Sprouty (SPRY) proteins, and SEF family members that modulate receptor signaling at several points in the signal transduction cascade. In addition, following activation, FGFRs are internalized and then degraded or recycled according to the level of ubiquitination [2, 4, 5].  In cancer, different FGFR pathway aberrations have been identified and include: (i) gene amplification or post-transcriptional regulation giving rise to receptor overexpression; (ii) FGFR mutations producing receptors that are either constitutively active or exhibit a reduced dependence on ligand binding for activation; (iii) translocations resulting in expression of FGFR-fusion proteins with constitutive FGFR kinase activity; (iv) alternative splicing of FGFR and isoform switching, which substantially alters ligand specificity increasing the range of FGFs that can stimulate tumor cells; and (v) upregulation of FGF expression in cancer or stromal cells and the enhanced release of FGFs from the extracellular matrix, resulting in paracrine/autocrine activation of the pathway. In humans, several gain-of-function germline mutations in the FGFR genes result in skeletal dysplasias, with FGFR2 mutations a common cause of craniosynostosis and FGFR3 mutations frequent in chondrodysplasia syndromes. Mutations in cancer resemble those seen in hereditary disorders and interestingly, they are not limited to the kinase domain but are spread over the complete length of the gene. Notably, FGFR signaling in cancer exhibits clear context-dependence, with aberrations differing according to tumor type [4\\u20138]. Table \\u200bTable11 summarizes the most frequent FGFR genomic deregulations in solid tumors and the details are discussed subsequently.  Table 1. Table 1. Common FGFR genomic deregulations in solid tumors Go to: FGFRs as oncogenic drivers in cancer breast cancer  FGFR family members are infrequently mutated but frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, and this is often accompanied by increased, or altered, expression of FGF ligands [9]. The 8p11-12 amplicon, which contains FGFR1, is observed in about 10% of breast cancer patients, predominantly hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease [9\\u201312]. Importantly, genes other than FGFR1 in the 8p11-12 amplicon are also likely to contribute to carcinogenesis [13\\u201315]. In addition, it is noteworthy to mention that FGFR1 is simultaneously amplified with an amplicon containing CCND1, FGF3, FGF4, and FGF19 on chromosome 11q12-14 in one-third of the samples, and in vitro studies suggests substantial functional interaction between the genes on 8p11-12 and 11q [16]. The 11q 12-14 amplicon is seen in \\u223c15%\\u201320% of human breast tumors [17, 18], and was shown to correlate with increased invasiveness in node-negative breast carcinoma [17]. FGFR1-overexpressed cancers are more likely to be progesterone receptor negative and present high proliferation, characteristics of the luminal-B subtype [19]. Large series have shown that FGFR1 amplification is an independent predictor of poor outcome [19, 20] and drives resistance to endocrine therapy [19]. No significant heterogeneity in FGFR1 amplification status has been observed after matching primary and metastatic carcinoma samples, although this observation is based on a small sample size [12].  Importantly, in vitro studies reinforce the potential oncogenic nature of FGFR1 amplification. Inhibition of FGFR1 kinase activity causes death of breast cancer-derived cell lines that overexpress FGFR1, indicating that these cells are addicted to the pathway for viability [11]. In vivo models of FGFR1-amplified breast cancer are challenging and still missing.  Additionally, FGFR2 has also been implicated in some cases of breast cancer, with gene amplification in 4% of triple-negative tumors [21]. FGFR2 amplification appears to promote breast tumorigenicity through maintenance of breast tumor-initiating cells [22]. In vitro studies showed that FGFR2-amplified cell lines have constitutive activation of the receptor and are highly sensitive to FGFR inhibition, with induction of apoptosis and decrease in the tumor-initiating cells population [21, 22].  Ligand-dependent signaling is also likely to play a key role in breast cancer. Basal-like breast cancer cell lines with epithelial\\u2013mesenchymal transition features and triple-negative breast cancers frequently express FGF2. RNA interference targeting of FGF2 in basal-like cell lines significantly reduced growth in vitro. Notably, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of FGFR induce tumor shrinkage in xenogafts models with an active autocrine FGF2 signaling loop [23]. These experiments highlight the potential driving role of the FGFR pathway in different subtypes of breast cancer. Figure \\u200bFigure11 portrays the relative expression of the FGFR(1-4) genes according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer microarray-based dataset, emphasizing the differences across the intrinsic subtypes of breast tumors [9]. The significance of FGFR4 activation in HER2-positive tumors still needs further investigation but it is noteworthy to mention that it is one of the HER2-enriched specific genes included in the 50-gene intrinsic subtype predictor (PAM50) [24].  Figure 1. Figure 1. Relative expression of the FGFR(1\\u20134) genes across the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer. Gene expression data and subtype calls have been obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer microarray-based dataset (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ ... lung cancer  FGFR1 is amplified in 10%\\u201320% of squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [25\\u201328]. In early-stage disease, it appears to correlate with increased cigarette smoking and poor survival [29]. Interestingly, recurrent FGFR1 amplification is also seen in 10%\\u201317% of head and neck [30] and 9% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas [31].  Preclinical studies clearly demonstrate that FGFR1 amplification confers dependence upon FGFR signaling. Treatment of FGFR1-amplified lung cancer cell lines with selective FGFR TKIs resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, in vivo xenograft models derived from both cell lines and patient tumors have also shown increased sensitivity with stasis or regressive effects [25, 32, 33]. Ligand-dependent epithelial\\u2013mesenchymal transition in NSCLC cell lines has been shown in vitro, and inhibition of FGFR signaling through antisense RNA or anti-FGF2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) led to inhibition of cellular proliferation and tumor growth [34].  In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), exome sequencing identified FGFR1 locus amplification in 6% of the tumors [35]. There is a clear correlation of high copy number gains in cytogenetic bands encoding FGFR1 and in vitro/in vivo sensitivity of SCLC models to FGFR inhibition [36, 37]. Paracrine production of FGFs has also been reported and high levels of serum FGF2 in SCLC are associated with a poor prognosis [38].  gastric cancer  FGFR2 amplification is found in 5%\\u201310% of gastric cancers, mainly in the aggressive diffuse subtype [39, 40]. Aberrations are mutually exclusive with other receptor tyrosine kinase amplifications (ERBB2, MET) [40]. In vitro, FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer cell lines are selectively sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of FGFR TKIs [41]. FGFR2 downregulation led to significant inhibition of cell growth and survival that further translated into tumor growth regression in vivo [42\\u201344]. Additional evidence of target dependence comes from xenograft models treated with anti-FGFR2 mAbs, which exhibit potent antitumor activity against gastric cancer driven by activated FGFR2 signaling [45, 46].  endometrial cancer  FGFR2 mutations occur in 12% of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas [47\\u201349]. The S252W and P253R substitutions in the extracellular domain, in particular, confer a gain in ligand-binding promiscuity by isoform-switching, thereby establishing an autocrine loop of pathway activation [50]. The N549K and K659E mutations in the kinase domain lead to ligand-independent, constitutively active FGFR2 [48]. Interestingly, FGFR2 mutations in endometrial cancer show a mutually exclusive pattern with mutations in KRAS [51]. In early-stage disease, they are associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival [51]. FGFR2-mutant endometrial cancer cell lines and in vivo tumor xenograft models are highly sensitive to FGFR TKIs, which reflects oncogenic addiction to the aberrant receptor [43, 44, 47].  urothelial cancer  Up to 80% of low-grade and low-stage tumors express mutant FGFR3, but this abnormality is found in less than 20% of invasive high-grade bladder cancer [52\\u201357]. The most common FGFR3 mutations in urothelial cell carcinoma occur in the extracellular and transmembrane domains (R248C, S249C, G370C, and Y373C) and lead to ligand-independent dimerization and constitutive activation [58]. Several mutations in the kinase domain of FGFR3 (K650E, K650M), leading to enhanced kinase activity, have also been described [58]. FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer are mutually exclusive with mutations in HRAS [59]. Multiple preclinical studies including bladder cell culture experiments and mouse models treated with small-molecule inhibitors and anti-FGFR3 mAbs reported decrease in cell proliferation and reduction in tumor growth [43, 60\\u201362]. Activity of an FGFR3-specific antagonistic antibody likely to disrupt dimerization, and hence activation, of the FGFR3 R248C and S249C mutants, was also extended to wild-type tumors that overexpress the receptor [60].  Fusions of the FGFR3 gene with transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC3) were recently identified in a subset of invasive bladder tumors (2 of 32 samples) [63]. The FGFR3 component lacks the final exon that includes PLC\\u03b3 binding site, leading to loss of negative regulation and higher expression of an active receptor. Notably, cell lines were extremely sensitive to selective FGFR inhibition [63].  brain tumors  A small subset of glioblastomas (3%\\u20137%) also harbors oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine kinase coding domains of FGFR1 or FGFR3 to TACC genes [64, 65]. This aberration is mutually exclusive with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), or MET amplifications, known drivers in brain tumors [65]. The fusion, caused by tandem duplication on 4p16.3, leads to loss of the 3\\u2032-UTR of FGFR3, blocking negative gene regulation and enhancing its expression [65]. In agreement with in vitro data showing constitutive kinase activity, in vivo models show that administration of an FGFR inhibitor prolongs survival of mice harboring FGFR3-TACC3-initiated gliomas [64].  sarcomas  Recurring somatic FGFR4 kinase domain mutations (K535 and E550) have been described in 8% of rhabdomyosarcoma patients. FGFR4 knockdown in a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line transplanted into mice reduced tumor growth and metastasis [66]. FGFR1 amplification was detected in a small subset of osteosarcomas (1 of 17 samples) and predicted sensitivity to a selective FGFR inhibitor in vitro [44]. Activation of FGFR signaling pathway as a result of amplification of the FRS2 adaptor was recently identified in dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Selective FGFR inhibitor was able to inhibit growth of cell lines with FRS2 and FGFR overexpression [67].  colorectal cancer  Colon cancer has been shown to overexpress FGF18 and FGF19, acting through the FGFR3-IIIc and FGFR4 receptors on the tumor cells [5]. An anti-FGF19 mAb that selectively blocks the interaction of FGF19 with FGFR4 inhibited growth of colon tumor xenografts in vivo, supporting a role for paracrine/autocrine FGFR activation in cancer maintenance [68].  hepatocellular carcinoma  Ligand-dependent signaling is also likely to play a role in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). FGF2 and FGFs 8, 17, 18, and 19 are upregulated and have been shown to initiate autocrine growth stimulation, cell survival, and neoangiogenesis in liver cancer [5]. Genetic knockdown of FGF19 inhibits the growth of HCC cell lines carrying the amplicon [69]. Targeting FGF19 with a mAb effectively prevented HCCs in FGF19 transgenic mice [68] and a humanized anti-FGFR4 mAb was reported to inhibit tumor growth in HCC xenograft models [70]. Interestingly, FGF19 amplification predicts sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors in vitro in HCC cell lines that express the coreceptor \\u03b2-klotho, which is essential for high-affinity interactions of FGF19 with FGFR4 [44].  prostate cancer  Extensive correlative studies in human prostate cancer as well as preclinical models indicate that FGFR signaling plays an important role in prostate cancer progression, epithelial\\u2013mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis. FGFR1 and FGFR4 are frequently overexpressed, several FGFs are upregulated, while expression of SEF, a negative regulator of the FGFR pathway, is reduced in aggressive cancers [5, 71]. Pathway addiction and a potential role for FGFR targeting in prostate cancer have also been documented. Neutralizing antibody against FGF8 displayed potent anti-tumor activity in mouse models [72] and FGFR TKI treatment was able to completely inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo [73].  Go to: FGFRs as angiogenic drivers in cancer FGFs directly promote endothelial cell proliferation and indirectly synergize with the VEGF and PDGF pathways, promoting tumor neoangiogenesis through complementary and overlapping functions. FGFR pathway activation has been shown to mediate resistance to anti-VEGF therapy [1, 3]. In the preclinical setting, tumors progressing to anti-VEGF treatment showed a higher expression of FGF2 and combined VEGFR and FGFR blockade led to increased antitumor activity in the setting of adaptive/evasive resistance [74]. Interestingly, FGF2 is higher in patients with colorectal cancer after the failure of bevacizumab-containing regimens [75] and in glioblastoma patients after treatment with a VEGFR TKI [76].  Go to: FGFRs as suppressors in cancer It is well recognized that context-dependent differences in signaling can lead to either tumor promotion or senescence in response to activated FGFR pathway. FGFR2 signaling is clearly oncogenic in many tumor models. However, several studies support a tumor protective effect of FGFR2 signaling, with FGFR2IIIb expression blocking proliferation in vitro and being downregulated on progression of multiple tumor types [2]. Loss-of-function FGFR2 mutations have been identified in 10% of melanoma tumors and cell lines and are the clearest indication of opposing roles of FGFRs in cancer [77]. These mutations result in receptor loss-of-function through several distinct mechanisms, including loss of ligand binding affinity (R251Q), impaired receptor dimerization (E219K), destabilization of the extracellular domains (G271E), and reduced kinase activity (D530N, I642V, and A648T) [77]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressive effects of FGFR2 are unknown and oncogene-induced senescence is a possible explanation for the distinct gene functions according to molecular context and tumor type.  Go to: resistance to FGFR targeting Limited preclinical data are available regarding resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Using functional RNA interference screens, loss of PTEN was identified as a potential mechanism of resistance that was specific to FGFR2-amplified cell lines [78]. Remarkably, ponatinib and the mTOR inhibitor ridaforolimus had a synergistic effect on the in vitro growth of endometrial cell lines bearing an activating FGFR2 mutation, irrespective of PTEN status [79]. In contrast, EGFR activation was identified as a resistance mechanism in FGFR3-mutant bladder cancer cell lines. Combinations of FGFR and EGFR inhibitors had increased efficacy both in vitro and in vivo [78]. The concept that activation of the HER family members could compensate for inhibition of FGFRs was also shown in other tumor types, including triple-negative breast cancer [80, 81]. In addition, in xenograft models of FGFR1 and MET co-activation, the combination of selective FGFR and MET inhibitors led to increased antitumor efficacy [80]. It should be noted that few data have been published on the molecular mechanism of cell death induced by FGFR inhibition in different cellular contexts [7]. In order to exploit the oncogene dependency for therapeutic gain, we need to understand the exact mechanism of oncogene addiction that exists in different cell types.  Furthermore, FGFR activation could potentially serve as a mechanism of acquired resistance to targeted therapies possibly related to the extensive cross-talk between FGF and oncogenic pathways. Pathway activation as a result of FGFs released in the tumor microenvironment has been implicated in resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC, cetuximab in KRAS wild-type squamous carcinoma cells and to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E melanoma cells [82\\u201387]. These data will allow rationale clinical testing of combination of FGFR inhibitors with other targeted agents.  Go to: translation to the clinic The strong evidence of increased sensitivity of multiple FGFR-aberrant cell lines and tumor models to FGFR inhibitors reveals a substantial therapeutic opportunity for selective intervention, validates oncogene addiction for proliferation and/or viability, and provides a rationale for the use of FGFR inhibitors in such instances.  Most FGFR inhibitors currently in development are small molecules kinase inhibitors of the ATP-binding domain. As the catalytic domains of various kinases exhibit significant structural homology, TKIs generally demonstrate activity against more than one kinase. This is a common feature of the first-generation of FGFR inhibitors, which generally have activity against VEGFR and/or PDGFR, two structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases. Multikinase inhibition may increase effectiveness in the treatment of a particular tumor type by disrupting redundant pathways that drive resistance. This might be valid when these agents are used as antiangiogenic therapies. Nevertheless, toxicity is expected to increase significantly and off-targets effects may be detrimental when FGFR is targeted in the context of the oncogene-addicted tumors discussed above, as side-effects may limit the ability to achieve doses required for effective FGFR inhibition. We are now in a unique position to validate clinically the many hypotheses that have been generated preclinically. In addition to selective FGFR TKIs, mAbs that bind to the extracellular domain of different FGFRs and compete with endogenous ligands (FGFs), thereby blocking FGFR dimerization and downstream activation, are also undergoing clinical testing.  Go to: toxicology and pharmacodynamics markers FGFRs are widely expressed in normal tissues and have a key role in development and physiology, notably the phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis. Preclinical models with highly potent selective FGFR TKIs have caused hyperphosphatemia-mediated tissue calcification owing to blockade of FGF23 release from bone and its signal in the kidney [88]. FGF23 binds FGFR4 and the IIIc isoforms of FGFR1 and FGFR3, but uncertainty remains about the relative contribution of individual FGFR subtypes to hyperphosphatemia [3, 8]. Therefore, increase in serum FGF23, phosphate, and vitamin D levels are potential biomarkers for effective FGFR inhibition. In early clinical trials with FGFR inhibitors, development of hyperphosphatemia as a class-specific toxicity may help in the definition of an optimal biological dose [89].  Additional mechanism-based toxicities observed in toxicology models include skin and other cutaneous events, as well as dose-dependent keratopathy and retinal pigment epithelial detachment. In contrast to multikinase VEGFR/FGFR inhibitors, efficacious doses of potent selective FGFR inhibitors do not induce elevations in blood pressure or proteinuria [90, 91].  Go to: multikinase (nonselective) FGFR inhibitors The most clinically advanced FGFR TKIs have dominant pharmacological activity in other kinases, such as VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3, RET, KIT, and BCR-ABL. These include brivanib, cediranib, nintedanib, lenvatinib, sulfatinib, dovitinib, ponatinib, and lucitanib. Although in vitro kinase and cellular activity of these compounds against FGFR1-3 is variable (IC50 ranging from 2 to >500 nM), multiple preclinical models showing increased activity in FGFR-deregulated tumors have been published. FGFR1 amplification in breast cancer cell lines predicts sensitivity to brivanib, dovitinib, ponatinib, and lucitanib [43, 92\\u201394]. In vitro and in vivo models of FGFR1-amplified lung cancer are highly sensitive to ponatinib and lucitanib as single agents [43, 94]. Cediranib, dovitinib, and ponatinib are very active in FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer models [40, 42, 43]. In addition, dovitinib and ponatinib also show significant antitumor activity in FGFR2-mutant endometrial and FGFR3-mutant bladder cancer xenografts [43, 62, 95].  Several of these molecules are being developed as antiangiogenic agents and trials are underway in a variety of tumor types irrespective of FGFR aberrations, such as nintedanib and brivanib in endometrial cancer (clinical trials.gov NCT01225887 and NCT00888173), as well as nintedanib and levantinib in lung cancer (NCT01441297, NCT01529112). Should there be any partial or complete responses in these trials it will be interesting to correlate with the amplification/mutation status of FGFR1/FGFR2. Levantinib has shown promising efficacy in HCC, but correlation with FGF upregulation when its indication is mainly based on the potent antiangiogenic activity is more challenging [96]. As seen in Table \\u200bTable2,2, clinical trials with multikinase FGFR inhibitors in patients selected based on FGFR aberrations are also in progress.  Table 2. Table 2. Genomically driven clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors The first reported trial, which evaluated the VEGFR/PDGFR/FGFR inhibitor dovitinib in FGFR1-amplified and nonamplified metastatic breast cancer, failed to reach its primary end point of improved overall response rate in the genomically selected arm [92]. However, in the subgroup with FGFR1 amplification, 13% had unconfirmed partial responses. Activity was observed primarily in the subgroup of patients with co-amplification of FGF3 as measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pharmacodynamic analysis indicates FGFR and VEGFR inhibition at tolerable doses, with consistent and maintained increase in serum FGF23, VEGF, and PDGF [92, 97].  More recently, the therapeutic potential of FGFR inhibition in breast cancer was uncovered with preliminary results of phase I trial with lucitanib, a potent VEGFR/FGFR inhibitor [98]. Enrollment in the expansion cohort at recommended doses was limited to patients whose tumors harbored FGFR1 amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or 11q amplification (locus of FGF3) as measured by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array. Seven of 10 assessable patients had a partial response, 4 with FGFR1-amplified breast tumors, and 3 with 11q amplification (one of them without concomitant FGFR1 amplification). Pharmacodynamic data confirming pathway inhibition is still pending [98]. Interestingly, hyperphosphatemia, an adverse event specific of potent FGFR inhibitors, was not consistently observed with lucitanib or dovitinib [92, 98]. The toxicity profile of these agents is mainly related to VEGFR inhibition, including hypertension, proteinuria, and hypothyroidism, but off-target effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity and asthenia were also dose-limiting [92, 98]. It remains to be proven whether the impressive efficacy of lucitanib is related to FGFR inhibition, VEGFR inhibition or the combination of targets, although prior clinical trials with other multikinase VEGFR inhibitors as single agents in unselected breast cancer patients showed disappointing results [99, 100]. The results of clinical trials with more selective FGFR inhibitors in FGFR-deregulated breast cancer will shed light on this issue. A confirmatory phase II trial with lucitanib will start recruitment soon.  Go to: selective FGFR inhibitors Many selective FGFR inhibitors have recently started clinical development. Phase I trials with BGJ398, AZD4547, LY2874455, and JNJ-42756493 are currently recruiting patients. The in vitro kinase activity of these compounds against FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 is very high (IC50 < 10 nM), with variable anti-FGFR4 activity. A patient-derived xenograft model of FGFR1-amplified lung cancer was highly sensitive to AZD4547 as single agent [32], and BGJ398 also demonstrated potent in vivo activity in FGFR2-amplified gastric and FGFR2-mutant endometrial cancer [44, 95]. Following stringent preclinical data suggesting oncogene addiction, clinical development is centered in FGFR-aberrant tumors, as shown in Table \\u200bTable22.  Early results of the ongoing phase I trials with BGJ398 and AZD4547 have been presented. In the BGJ398 study, patients with advanced solid tumors showing FGFR1 or FGFR2 amplification or FGFR3 mutation are still been recruited. Results of the first 29 patients (18 with FGFR1-amplified tumors) are available [101]. The most frequently observed adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and hyperphosphatemia (about one-third of the patients) and dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 elevations in transaminase levels and grade 2 corneal events. The incidence of hyperphosphatemia increased at higher doses of BGJ398 but could be managed with phosphate binders and diuretics. One lung cancer patient with FGFR1 amplification by FISH analysis had a confirmed partial response. Preliminary efficacy data in the breast cancer population with FGFR aberrations was disappointing, with no partial responses in the first 13 patients recruited [101]. With regards to AZD4547, dose-limiting toxicities included renal failure (pyelonephritis, dehydration), mucositis, increase in transaminase levels and hyperphosphatemia [102]. In addition to dose-proportional increase in phosphate and vitamin D levels, other potential mechanism-based toxicities included alopecia, nail disorders, dry skin, and asymptomatic retinal pigment epithelial detachment. Investigators did not report soft-tissue calcification. Human exposure at recommended phase II doses was consistent with exposures in preclinical models that induced tumor regressions. Of 20 patients with FGFR pathway aberrations, 5 had clinical benefit as assessed by investigators, 3 of them with significant tumor shrinkage: 1 patient with FGFR1-amplified squamous NSCLC had a confirmed partial response; 1 with FGFR1-amplified breast cancer patient presented 25% decrease in the size of target lesions; and 1 with FGFR3-mutant bladder cancer had 23% reduction in tumor size for more than 6 months. Clinical benefit appeared to be higher in those with high-level FGFR1 amplification (FGFR1/CEP8 ratio >2.8 by FISH) [102]. A phase II study evaluating AZD4547 in combination with endocrine therapy in breast cancer has recently started accrual (NCT01202591).  Go to: monoclonal antibodies targeting the FGFR pathway Therapeutic mAbs can be highly specific for a particular FGF ligand or FGFR isoform, hence displaying a more narrow range of toxicity when compared with pan-FGFR inhibitors. Specific inhibition of a particular oncogenic FGFR molecule, including splice variants that are selectively upregulated in tumor cells, would avoid targeting different FGFR isoforms that have opposing effects in cancer cells. In addition, by recruiting the immune system via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antitumor activity might be increased. Several antibodies targeting the FGFR pathway have been assessed in preclinical studies in a variety of solid tumors, including gastric, bladder, prostate cancer, and HCC, as described above.  The first agent to move into the clinic was FP-1039, a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human FGFR1 linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. It was engineered to spare the metabolic hormone FGFs (including FGF23 involved in phosphate and vitamin D metabolism) and to bind tightly to all of the mitogenic FGF ligands [103]. In vivo models with genetic aberrations in the FGFR pathway, including FGFR1-amplified lung cancer and FGFR2-mutated endometrial cancer, were particularly sensitive to FP-1039-mediated tumor inhibition. In addition, it was shown to block FGF- and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo [103]. The final report of the phase I trial with FP-1039 is still pending but it does not appear to significantly increase serum calcium and phosphate levels or induce hypertension or proteinuria [103]. Unfortunately, a phase II study testing FP-1039 in FGFR2 S252W or P253R mutant endometrial cancer patients was not feasible. The original assumption was that at least 5% of patients screened would qualify, but after screening 70 patients, none qualified (NCT01244438).  Another antibody targeting the FGFR pathway tested in the clinic is the human anti-FGFR3 agent MFGR1877S [104]. Based on preclinical data showing activity of the compound in bladder cancer with FGFR3 overexpression or mutations, the phase I trial was enriched with patients diagnosed with advanced urothelial carcinomas. Five of the 10 bladder cancer patients had stable disease as their best response (4 remained on study for more than three cycles). Dose-limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia in one patient, and the drug was escalated until effective doses based on preclinical models [104]. Future development of this compound and other mAbs targeting the FGFR pathway is unknown at this time.  Go to: challenges in the clinical development of FGFR inhibitors Despite promising preliminary results with FGFR inhibition in genetically selected tumors, many logistical challenges related to prescreening strategies and biomarker platform selection will need to be overcome for successful clinical development of this class of agents. We need to define precisely the alterations associated with pathway addiction taking into consideration context-dependency of the FGFR signaling. In parallel, optimal molecular diagnostic procedures for FGFR aberrations need to be developed, as companion diagnostics will be required to enroll patients in clinical trials. As an example, the definition of FGFR1/2 amplification based on in situ hybridization techniques varied significantly in the published literature, as shown in Table \\u200bTable33.  Table 3. Table 3. Definition of FGFR1/2 amplification based on in situ hybridization techniques in retrospective studies and or clinical trials Many limitations for a consensus definition of FGFR pathway activation became clear during the last years. First, there is a marked genomic heterogeneity in the FGFR1 amplicon structure in breast (broad) and squamous NSCLC (focal) and the influence of these differences on the degree of FGFR addiction is unknown. Second, in situ hybridization analyses showed that tumors might exhibit a focal and heterogenous pattern of amplification with frequent polysomy of CEN8; this could lead to an FGFR1/CEN8 ratio below 2.0 despite an increase in absolute numbers of FGFR1 signals compared with normal tissue. Empiric data will be required to define the exact amplification cut-off that predicts anti-FGFR therapy response. In the meantime, our molecular pathology laboratories have been applying the HER2 FISH CAP/ASCO (College of American Pathologists/American Society of Clinical Oncology) guidelines to score FGFR (amplified is either FGFR/CEP ratio >2.2 or average FGFR gene copy number >6 signals/nucleus). Assays for detecting FGFR fusions will be challenging, as at least some of the variants such as FGFR3-TACC3 are not amenable to traditional FISH analysis as the genes map too close to each other.  Standardized definition of pathway activation becomes an even more difficult problem for identifying tumors in which paracrine/autocrine signaling is potentially driving tumor cell proliferation. Ligand amplification can be detected by many different techniques, such as RT-PCR, array CGHs, microarrays, and RNA sequencing. Thus far, the inconsistent definitions of FGFs amplifications make their use investigational in nature, although early trials have clearly shown that ligand amplification might help define the population of patients with higher chances of response. Importantly, molecular testing is also evolving, moving from \\u2018one test-one drug\\u2019 paradigm to multiplex approaches looking for mutations, amplifications, and gene fusions [105, 106]. More robust and reproducible genomic platforms that can screen alterations of multiple FGF-pathway components in a single assay are being gradually incorporated into the prescreening process of FGFR inhibitors trials. With massively parallel sequencing, the number of clinically significant and potentially predictive oncogenic aberrations in the FGFR pathway is expected to increase. This is illustrated by the recent finding of intragenic duplications of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain in grade II diffuse childhood gliomas [107], recurrent FGFR1 hotspot mutations in pediatric pilocytic astrocytomas [108], as well as TKI-sensitive FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations in squamous NSCLC [109]. Newly rare but recurrent FGFR2 and FGFR3 fusions were also described across multiple solid tumors, including cholangiocarcinomas and squamous NSCLC [110, 111]. These rearrangements apparently share the mechanism of pathway activation, with different fusion partners mediating oligomerization, which triggers overexpression of the respective FGFR kinase. Patients whose tumors harbor these FGFR fusions are being referred to clinical trials with FGFR inhibitors and the preliminary results are eagerly anticipated.  Finally, investigators should keep an open mind during biomarker-driven clinical development of targeted therapies. First, selective FGFR inhibitors might have a more favorable safety profile when compared with multikinase inhibitors and hence could be combined with other targeted agents. Taking into consideration preliminary data showing that the clinical responses of FGFR-amplified tumors to selective FGFR inhibitors have not been impressively high, we envision that rational combination strategies with other targeted agents should be further explored, promising partners being endocrine therapies, anti-EGFR and downstream PI3K pathway or RAF/MEK inhibitors. On the other hand, the clinical activity of selective FGFR inhibitors as single agents in highly addicted FGFR(1\\u20134) mutated and FGFR(2\\u20133) rearranged tumors is still unknown. Nevertheless, mechanism-based toxicities of FGFR inhibitors may be particularly difficult to control and their long-term consequences are unknown. Table \\u200bTable44 summarizes a specific toxicity management protocol for hyperphosphatemia based on our experience during early clinical development of these agents. Second, multikinase nonselective FGFR inhibitors may show significant antitumor activity in both FGFR wild-type and mutant tumors as well as superior efficacy in FGFR-aberrant tumors by co-targeting parallel pathways, therefore allowing greater flexibility in patient selection. Correctly designing clinical trials to address these different hypotheses is crucial [112]. Third, antiangiogenic activity of potent VEGFR/FGFR TKIs makes this class of agents suitable in the setting of resistance to prior anti-VEGF therapies, directing clinical investigation of these compounds toward tumor types without FGFR genomic aberrations.  Table 4. Table 4. Guidelines for management of hyperphoshatemia related to FGFR inhibitors Go to: conclusion Targeting FGFRs is a promising therapeutic strategy in a variety of cancers. Early clinical data confirm preclinical studies suggesting that in some tumor types, FGFRs may act as oncogenes to which cancer cells are addicted. Nevertheless, in the clinical scenario, questions such as what class of agents is the most promising (nonselective versus selective FGFR inhibitors) and whether combination therapies are needed in order to obtain meaningful clinical benefit are still unsolved. Successful development will ultimately depend on the selection of tumors in which FGF signaling is driving proliferation and survival. Widespread use of in situ hybridization techniques and massively parallel sequencing tests will facilitate the identification of additional diseases in which the therapeutic use of FGFR inhibitors is worth testing. In this context, histology-independent trials (\\u2018basket\\u2019 design) enrolling patients with different FGFR genomic aberrations could be very informative with regard to future directions for clinical investigation of these compounds. Notably, not all activating mutations in FGFR(1\\u20134) can be effectively targeted by current selective FGFR inhibitors. Therefore, functional experiments designed to determine which aberrations play causative roles in tumorigenesis are required in order to fully understand the clinical implications of genomic data. Eventually, continued translational research in the field will further strengthen the role of FGF signaling in cancer biology and allow personalized use of FGFR inhibitors at the clinic. The response rate to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is relatively low (0.7%-3%), however, rapid and drastic tumor regression is occasionally observed. The molecular backgrounds and clinico-pathological features of these responders remain largely unclear. We analyzed the clinical and molecular backgrounds of 13 responders to sorafenib with significant tumor shrinkage in a retrospective study. A comparative genomic hybridization analysis using one frozen HCC sample from a responder demonstrated that the 11q13 region, a rare amplicon in HCC including the loci for FGF3 and FGF4, was highly amplified. A real-time polymerase chain reaction\\u2013based copy number assay revealed that FGF3/FGF4 amplification was observed in three of the 10 HCC samples from responders in which DNA was evaluable, whereas amplification was not observed in 38 patients with stable or progressive disease (P = 0.006). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed FGF3 amplification. In addition, the clinico-pathological features showed that multiple lung metastases (5/13, P = 0.006) and a poorly differentiated histological type (5/13, P = 0.13) were frequently observed in responders. A growth inhibitory assay showed that only one FGF3/FGF4-amplified and three FGFR2-amplified cancer cell lines exhibited hypersensitivity to sorafenib in vitro. Finally, an in vivo study revealed that treatment with a low dose of sorafenib was partially effective for stably and exogenously expressed FGF4 tumors, while being less effective in tumors expressing EGFP or FGF3. Conclusion: FGF3/FGF4 amplification was observed in around 2% of HCCs. Although the sample size was relatively small, FGF3/FGF4 amplification, a poorly differentiated histological type, and multiple lung metastases were frequently observed in responders to sorafenib. Our findings may provide a novel insight into the molecular background of HCC and sorafenib responders, warranting further prospective biomarker studies. (HEPATOLOGY 2013) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer-related cause of death in the world annually, and the development of new primary tumors, recurrences, and metastasis are the most common causes of mortality among patients with HCC.1, 2 Sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc.) is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that is classified as an anti-angiogenic inhibitor.3 Sorafenib inhibits the kinase activities of Raf-1 and B-Raf in addition to vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor \\u03b2, Flt-3, and c-KIT. Two large randomized controlled trials reported a significant clinical benefit of single-agent sorafenib in extending overall survival in both Western and Asian patients with advanced unresectable HCC.4, 5 Consequently, sorafenib is now used as a standard therapy for HCC. The mechanisms of action that lead to these remarkably prolonged overall survival periods are thought to result from the anti-angiogenic effects of sorafenib and its characteristic inhibitory effect on Raf-1 and B-Raf signaling. In these trials, a partial response was observed in 0.7% (2/299) and 3.3% (5/150) of the patients treated with sorafenib.4-5  Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that some responders exhibit rapid tumor regression as a result of sorafenib treatment for HCC. Complete responses were observed in two patients with advanced HCC and multiple lung metastases, with rapid tumor regression observed even after short-term treatment with sorafenib.6, 7 The drastic tumor response to sorafenib seems to be similar to the tumor response obtained using other tyrosine kinase inhibitors to target a deregulated signal in cancer cells. For example, constitutively active mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in non\\u2013small cell lung cancer are associated with a striking treatment response to gefitinib, a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.8, 9 We hypothesized that these HCC cells may harbor a genetic background conducive to a drastic response to sorafenib, rather than the typical anti-angiogenic effect. In this study, we retrospectively searched for genetic changes using mainly formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from patients with HCC who had undergone sorafenib treatment.  Abbreviations 5FU, 5-fluorouracil; CGH, comparative genomic hybridization; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FFPE, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration; mRNA, messenger RNA; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PIVKA-II, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II; RPMI-1640, Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640; RT-PCR, reverse-transcription PCR. Patients and Methods  Reagent and Cell Culture.  Sorafenib was provided by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Montville, NJ). All cell lines used in this study were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI-1640) medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) except for IM95, OUMS23, Colo320, WiDr, HLF, HLE, Huh7, and HepG2 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM]; Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan); LoVo (F12; Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan); KYSE180, KYSE220, and KYSE270 (RPMI-1640:F12, 1:1); KYSE150 (F12); and KYSE70 (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) or 2% FBS for the KYSE series plus penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\\u00b0C. These cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Collection (Sennan-shi, Osaka, Japan). Patients and Samples.  The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: patients with histologically confirmed HCC who had been treated with sorafenib, from whom pretreatment tumor samples were available. Finally, the clinical characteristics of a total of 55 cases of HCC from 12 medical centers were evaluated retrospectively. In the gene copy number analysis, four samples were excluded because of an insufficient quantity of DNA, two samples were excluded because of the poor quality of the DNA and two samples were response not evaluable. One not evaluable sample was poor DNA quality. Thus, the copy number assay was performed using the remaining 48 samples. Meanwhile, a series of 82 HCC samples were obtained from frozen specimens of surgical specimens at the Kinki University Faculty of Medicine. The tumor response was evaluated using computerized tomography according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; the response was then classified as a complete response, a partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, or not evaluable. The clinico-pathological features evaluated included age, sex, viral infection, alpha-fetoprotein level, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), clinical stage, primary tumor size, metastatic lesion, histological type, treatment response, and duration of sorafenib treatment. The present study was approved by the institutional review boards of all the centers involved in the study, and informed consent was obtained from the patients. Isolation of Genomic DNA.  Genomic DNA samples were extracted from deparaffinized tissue sections preserved as FFPE tissue using a QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from surgical frozen sections using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Comparative Genomic Hybridization Analysis.  The Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to perform array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on genomic DNA from HCC and paired liver samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with both Nsp I and Sty I in independent parallel reactions, subjected to restriction enzymes, ligated to the adaptor, and amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a universal primer and TITANIUM Taq DNA Polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alt, CA). The PCR products were quantified, fragmented, end-labeled, and hybridized onto a Genome-wide Human SNP6.0 Array. After washing and staining in Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix), the arrays were scanned to generate CEL files using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 and GeneChip Operating Software version 1.4. In the array CGH analysis, sample-specific copy number changes were analyzed using Partek Genomic Suite 6.4 software (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). Copy Number Assay.  The copy numbers for FGF3 and FGF4 were determined using commercially available and predesigned TaqMan Copy Number Assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described.10 The primer IDs used for the FGFs were as follows: FGF3, Hs06336027_cn; FGF4, HS01235235_cn. The TERT locus was used for the internal reference copy number. Human Genomic DNA (Clontech) and DNA from noncancerous FFPE tissue were used as a normal control. Real-Time Reverse-Transcription PCR.  Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described.11 In brief, complementary DNA was prepared from the total RNA obtained from each surgical frozen section using a GeneAmp RNA-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR amplification was performed using a Thermal Cycler Dice (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions under the following conditions: 95\\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of 95\\u00b0C for 10 seconds and 60\\u00b0C for 30 seconds. The primers used for the real-time RT-PCR were as follows: FGF3, 5\\u2032-TTT GGA GAT AAC GGC AGT GGA-3\\u2032 (forward) and 5\\u2032-CGT ATT ATA GCC CAG CTC GTG GA-3\\u2032 (reverse); FGF4, 5\\u2032-GAG CAG CAA GGG CAA GCT CTA-3\\u2032 (forward) and 5\\u2032-ACC TTC ATG GTG GGC GAC A-3\\u2032 (reverse); GAPD, 5\\u2032-GCA CCG TCA AGG CTG AGA AC-3\\u2032 (forward) and 5\\u2032-ATG GTG GTG AAG ACG CCA GT-3\\u2032 (reverse). GAPD was used to normalize expression levels in the subsequent quantitative analyses. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Analysis.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as described.10 Probes designed to detect the FGF3 gene and CEN11p on chromosome 11 were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas red and were designed to hybridize to the adjacent genomic sequence spanning approximately 0.32 Mb and 0.63 Mb, respectively. The probes were generated from appropriate clones from a library of human genomic clones (GSP Laboratory, Kawasaki, Japan). Immunoblotting.  Western blot analysis was performed as described.11 The following antibodies were used: monoclonal FGF3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), FGF4 and FGFR2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and phosphorylated FGFR and horseradish peroxidase\\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). NIH-3T3 cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of sorafenib for 2 hours and were then stimulated with FGF4-conditioned medium for 20 minutes. Cell Growth Inhibitory Assay.  To evaluate growth inhibition in the presence of various concentrations of sorafenib, we used an MTT assay as described.12 Plasmid Construction, Viral Production, and Stable Transfectants.  The methods used in this section have been described.12 The complementary DNA fragment encoding human full-length FGF3 or FGF4 was isolated using PCR and Prime STAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) with following primers: FGF3, 5\\u2032-GG GAA TTC GCC GCC ATG GGC CTA ATC TGG CTG CTA-3\\u2032 (forward) and 5\\u2032-CC CTC GAG GCC CAG CTA GTG CGC ACT GGC CTC-3\\u2032 (reverse); FGF4, 5\\u2032-GG GAA TTC GCC GCC ATG TCG GGG CCC GGG ACG GCC GCG GTA GCG C-3\\u2032 (forward) and 5\\u2032-CC CTC GAG GGA GGG TCA CAG CCT GGG GAG GAA GTG GGT GAC CTT C-3\\u2032 (reverse). The stable transfectants expressing EGFP or FGF3 or FGF4 for each cell line were designated as A549/EGFP, A549/FGF3, and A549/FGF4. Xenograft Studies.  Nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu, 6-week-old females; CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo) were used for in vivo studies and were cared for in accordance with the recommendations for the handling of laboratory animals for biomedical research compiled by the Committee on Safety and Ethical Handling Regulations for Laboratory Animal Experiments, Kinki University. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with a total of 5 \\u00d7 106 A549/EGFP, A549/FGF3, or A549/FGF4 cells. Two weeks after inoculation, the mice were randomized according to tumor size into two groups to equalize the mean pretreatment tumor size among the three groups (n = 20 mice per group). The mice were then treated with a low dose of oral sorafenib (n = 10, 15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle control (n = 10, Cremophor EL/ethanol/water) for 9 days. Tumor volume was calculated as length \\u00d7 width2 \\u00d7 0.5 and was assessed every 2 to 3 days. Statistical Analysis.  The statistical analyses were performed to test for differences between groups using the Student t test or Fisher's exact test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using PAWS Statistics 18 (SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Results  Responder to Sorafenib Who Harbored FGF3/FGF4 Gene Amplification.  A 58-year-old woman was diagnosed as having histologically confirmed advanced HCC (Fig. 1A, left panel) with multiple lung metastases. She received combination treatment with sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and interferon, and a subsequent treatment assessment revealed a partial response. Because the disease was well controlled with sorafenib treatment for 14 months (Fig. 1A, right panel), surgery was performed. To characterize this tumor molecularly, we performed array CGH analysis using frozen surgical specimens of the HCC region and paired background liver tissue as a reference control. The array CGH analysis revealed a low-level gain in the genomic DNA copy number for 1q, 8q, 10p, and 18p and a high level gain at 11q13 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the 11q13 region, a rare amplicons in HCC that contains several genes, including FGF3, FGF4, CCND1, and FGF19, was highly amplified over 20 copies (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis revealed that FGF3 was overexpressed in the HCC specimen compared with the paired background liver specimen (Fig. 1D).  Figure 1.  Figure 1.

(D) Western blot analysis of FGF3 (arrow) in HCC and paired background liver samples. IB, immunoblotting. The 11q13 locus is known to be a frequently amplified region in several human cancers except HCC.13 Thus, we hypothesized that the amplification of 11q13 may be involved in a marked response to sorafenib. FGF3/FGF4 Gene Amplification Is Frequently Observed in Responders to Sorafenib.  To address the question of whether FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification is also found in the HCC of other responders to sorafenib, we examined HCC specimens collected from 11 other medical centers in Japan. Because most of the HCC samples were collected as FFPE samples, we used a TaqMan Copy number assay.10 A copy number assay revealed that FGF3/FGF4 amplification was observed in three of the 10 (30%) HCC samples that responded to sorafenib, whereas no amplification was observed in the 38 specimens from patients with stable or progressive disease (P = 0.006, Fig. 2A). The copy numbers for FGF3/FGF4 were 10.2 \\u00b1 0.8/6.7 \\u00b1 0.8, 26.7 \\u00b1 0.4/35.1 \\u00b1 3.1, and 162.5 \\u00b1 9.0/165.0 \\u00b1 12.5 copies in the amplified samples, whereas the copy numbers of FGF3 for all the other samples were below 5 copies. The correlation between the FGF3 locus and the FGF4 locus copy numbers was very high (R = 0.998), indicating that the DNA copy number assay for FGF3/FGF4 was a sensitive and reproducible method.  Figure 2.  Figure 2.  Open in figure viewer FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification is frequently observed in responders to sorafenib in HCC. (A) FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification was determined using the TaqMan copy number assay in DNA samples obtained from 48 HCC samples that had been treated with sorafenib.

(B) FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification mediates the overexpression of FGF3/FGF4 mRNA. The mRNA expression levels of FGF3 and FGF4 were examined in nine HCC samples that were available as frozen samples among 48 HCC samples that were treated with sorafenib. Rel. mRNA, target gene/GAPD \\u00d7 106. FGF3/FGF4 Gene Amplification Mediates the Overexpression of FGF3/FGF4 Messenger RNA.  We examined the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of FGF3/FGF4 in nine HCC samples that were available as frozen samples among the 48 sorafenib-treated samples, as shown in Fig. 2A. One amplified sample expressed extremely high mRNA levels of FGF3/FGF4 compared with nonamplified samples (Fig. 2B). The results demonstrated that FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification mediates the overexpression of FGF3/FGF4 mRNAs and proteins (Figs. 2B and 1D). FISH Analysis Confirmed FGF3/FGF4 Gene Amplification.  We used FISH analysis to examine FGF3/FGF4 amplification and to verify the results of the above-described PCR-based DNA copy number assay. All FGF3/FGF4-amplified clinical samples were confirmed as exhibiting high-level FGF3 amplification using FISH analysis (Fig. 3). One patient showed multiple scattered signals, whereas two patients showed large clustered signals. Nonamplified HCC yielded a negative result for gene amplification. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of FGF3/FGF4-amplified HCC among the clinical samples, and the FISH analysis results were consistent with those for the copy number assay.  Figure 3.

High-power images are presented in each inset for a single cancer cell. Amp, gene amplification. Frequency of FGF3/FGF4 Gene Amplification in HCC.  To determine the frequency of FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification in HCC, we performed a copy number assay for HCC samples without sorafenib treatment in a series of surgical specimens. Two of the 82 (2.4%) HCC samples exhibited FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification, with copy numbers of 10.7/15.3 and 133.3/112.7 copies, respectively (Fig. 4). One amplified HCC was a poorly differentiated tumor, whereas the other was a moderately differentiated tumor.  Figure 4.  Figure 4.  Open in figure viewer FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification in a series of HCC samples without sorafenib treatment. TaqMan copy number assay for FGF3 and FGF4 was used to examine DNA samples obtained from 82 surgical specimens. Human normal genomic DNA was used as a normal control. Well, well-differentiated HCC; Mod, moderately differentiated HCC; Poor, poorly differentiated HCC. Clinicopathological Features of Responders to Sorafenib.  The clinico-pathological features of the sorafenib responders are shown in Table 1. A comparison of clinical factors (age, sex, viral status, alpha-fetoprotein level, PIVKA-II, clinical stage, primary tumor size, metastatic status, histological type, and tumor response between responders and nonresponders) is given in Table 2. Notably, multiple lung metastases over five nodules was significantly higher among responders to sorafenib (responders, 5/13 [38%]; nonresponders, 2/42 [5%]; P = 0.006). Although the difference was not significant, poorly differentiated HCC tended to be more common among responders to sorafenib (responders, 5/13 [38%]; nonresponders, 6/42 [14%]; P = 0.13). These results suggest that multiple lung metastases and a poorly differentiated histology may be clinical biomarkers for sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC.  Table 1.

We examined the growth inhibitory effect of sorafenib in various cancer cell lines to evaluate whether activated FGFR signaling is involved in the response to sorafenib. Among 26 cell lines, KYSE220 was the only FGF3/FGF4-amplified cell line (data not shown), and HSC-43, HSC-39, and KATOIII were the only FGFR2-amplified cell lines.14 Sorafenib potently inhibited cellular growth in these four cell lines at a sub-\\u03bcM 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) (Fig. 5A). The IC50 values were as follows: HSC43, 0.8 \\u03bcM; HSC39, 0.6 \\u03bcM; KATOIII, 0.4 \\u03bcM; and KYSE220, 0.18 \\u03bcM. These results suggest that activated FGFR signaling may be involved in the response to sorafenib.  Figure 5.  Figure 5.

Sorafenib Inhibits Tumor Growth in FGF4-Introducing Cell Lines In Vivo.  Finally, we established cancer cell lines stably overexpressing EGFP, FGF3, or FGF4 to examine the relationship between the gene function of FGF3 or FGF4 and drug sensitivity to sorafenib in vivo. Western blotting confirmed that exogenously expressed FGF3 and FGF4 were secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 5B). Sorafenib inhibited the FGF4-conditioned, medium-mediated expression levels of phosphorylated FGFR (Figure 5C). A similar result was obtained using recombinant FGF4 (data not shown). Mice inoculated with these cell lines were treated with a low dose of oral sorafenib (15 mg/kg/day) or without sorafenib (vehicle control). FGF3 overexpression did not increase the tumor volume compared with EGFP tumors; however, FGF4 overexpression aggressively increased tumor volume and clearly enhanced the malignant phenotype (Fig. 5D). Notably, the low-dose sorafenib treatment significantly inhibited the growth of the A549/FGF4 tumors, whereas it was not effective against A549/EGFP and A549/FGF3 tumors (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that overexpression of FGF4 is partially involved in the response to sorafenib. Discussion  The FGF3 gene was first identified and characterized based on its similarity to the mouse fgf3/int-2 gene, which is a proto-oncogene activated in virally induced mammary tumors in mice.15 Meanwhile, the FGF4 gene was first identified in gastric cancer as an oncogene HST, which has the ability to induce the neoplastic transformation of NIH-3T3 cells upon transfection.16 These genes were initially regarded as proto-oncogenes. FGF3 and FGF4 genes are located side-by-side and are also closely located to the FGF19 and CCND1 genes (within 0.2 Mb of the 11q13 region).13 The 11q13 region is known as a gene-dense region, and gene amplification of this region is frequently observed in various solid cancers (including breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, esophageal cancer, and melanoma) at frequencies of 13%-60%.13 On the other hand, the frequency of FGF3/FGF4 amplification in HCC remains largely unclear. Relatively small cohort studies have reported that one out of 20 HCCs exhibited FGF3 amplification as determined via CGH analysis,17 and 3 out of 45 HCCs examined using Southern blot analysis had a copy number >5;18 meanwhile, amplification was not detected in 0 out of 42 surgically resected HCCs.19 In the present study, two of the 82 (2.4%) HCC samples exhibited FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification in the HCC series. If only 2%-3% of HCC patients harbor the FGF3/FGF4 amplification, its value as a biomarker seems to be limited in clinics because a frequency of 2%-3% is too low to stratify the patients for specific targeted therapy. However, a combination of biomarkers\\u2014including FGF3/FGF4 amplification, lung metastasis, tumor differentiation, and other unrevealed dysregulation of FGFR signaling\\u2014may increase the response prediction. In addition, 2%-3% of FGF3/FGF4 amplification may be a promising therapeutic target for future FGFR-targeted therapies in the treatment of HCC.  Tumor shrinkage might be due to the mixed effect (sorafenib + 5FU + interferon) of combination therapy in the initially described patient. However, during this patient's long clinical course, tumor regrowth was observed following withdrawal of sorafenib because of oral hemorrhage, and tumor reshrinkage was observed when sorafenib treatment recommenced. Thus, we considered that tumor shrinkage might be achieved by the effect of sorafenib on its own, rather than 5FU + interferon.  Regarding determinants of drug sensitivity to sorafenib, the mechanism of hypersensitivity in the gastric cancer cell lines HSC-39, HSC-43, and KATO-III is FGFR2 gene amplification and is thought to be the addiction of these cell lines to this gene,14 since sorafenib has a relatively weak but significant inhibitory effect on FGFR1 at a concentration of 580 \\u00b1 100 nM.3 This result suggests that the blockade of FGFR signaling by sorafenib may lead to a significant treatment response, at least in FGFR2-amplified cells. In this study, we found that FGF4, but not FGF3 overexpression, was partially involved in the sensitivity to sorafenib in vivo. The limitations of the study are the small number of responder patients and the potential bias in their selection because of the retrospective study design. Further clinical study of responders to sorafenib is necessary. We are presently undertaking a prospective molecular translational study (2010-2012) in a cohort of Japanese patients with sorafenib-treated HCC.  Multiple lung metastases were frequently observed among responders to sorafenib (38%) but were less common among nonresponders (5%). Based on a Japanese follow-up survey of patients with primary HCC, lung metastasis was observed in 7% (169/2355) of the patients at the time of autopsy.20 Another study demonstrated that 15% of patients were found to have extrahepatic metastases, and lung metastasis was detected in 6% of 995 consecutive HCC patients.21 When compared with these data from large-scale studies, the frequency of lung metastasis among responders to sorafenib seems quite high. In addition, a poorly differentiated histological type tended to be more common among responders, although the correlation was not significant.  In conclusion, we found that FGF3/FGF4 gene amplification, multiple lung metastases, and a poorly differentiated histological type may be involved in the response to sorafenib.\",\n          \" ABSTRACT To look for a direct role of ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure in cutaneous melanoma induction, we studied xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients who have defective DNA repair resulting in a 1000-fold increase in melanoma risk. These XP melanomas have the same anatomic distribution as melanomas in the general population. We analyzed laser capture microdissection samples of skin melanomas from XP patients studied at the National Institutes of Health. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN was sequenced and analyzed for UV-induced mutations. Samples from 59 melanomas (47 melanomas in situ and 12 invasive melanomas) from 8 XP patients showed mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in 56% of the melanomas. Further, 91% of the melanomas with mutations had 1 to 4 UV type base substitution mutations (occurring at adjacent pyrimidines) (P < 0.0001 compared to random mutations). We found a high frequency of amino-acid-altering mutations in the melanomas and demonstrated that these mutations impaired PTEN function; UV damage plays a direct role in induction of mutations and in inactivation of the PTEN gene in XP melanomas including in situ, the earliest stage of melanoma. This gene is known to be a key regulator of carcinogenesis and therefore these data provide solid mechanistic support for UV protection for prevention of melanoma.  Keywords: DNA repair, ultraviolet radiation, PTEN, skin cancer, laser capture microdissection Melanoma mortality for Caucasians in the U.S. has increased at an annual rate of 1.5% from 1950 to 2005. For 2008, more than 110,000 new cases of melanoma [about 50,000 melanoma in situ (MIS) and 60,000 invasive melanomas (IM)] are estimated with more than 8,000 deaths (1, 2). The causative relationship between UV exposure and non-melanoma skin cancer is well documented (3\\u20136), and important molecular targets have been identified in basal cell carcinoma (patched protein in the hedgehog pathway) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (p53) in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients (7\\u20139). In contrast, the relationship between sunlight exposure and melanoma is less well understood but still apparent (10, 11). The role of UV exposure in melanoma pathogenesis is complex and has some paradoxical features (5, 10, 12). In the U.S. Caucasian population and in XP patients, the site distribution of melanomas is similar. However, this anatomic distribution is different from that of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and does not correspond to the most sun exposed areas of the body (face, head, and neck) (5, 13). Similarly, melanoma is more closely associated with intermittent intense sun exposure rather than long term, constant exposure as in SCC (5, 6). On the other hand, melanomas can be induced in some animals by exposure to UV (14\\u201316).  Solar UV (including UVB and UVA) induces photoproducts at adjacent pyrimidines, predominately cyclobutane dimers and 6\\u20134 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (17), which, if not repaired, can lead to base substitution mutations at the site of damage (17, 18). XP patients, who have defective DNA repair, have a 1000-fold increase in melanoma and individual patients often have multiple melanomas (4, 19). XP thus provides a powerful model for the study of the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma in humans and permits evaluation of a large number of melanomas with the same exposure history and genetic background in a small number of patients. While the mechanism of induction of UV damage in cells from normal individuals and in XP patients is the same, the effects of UV damage are amplified in XP since the damage is not repaired.  The functional loss of tumor suppressor genes is a fundamental cause of cancer progression. The p53 tumor suppressor gene has been shown to have a high frequency of UV type base substitution mutations in human cutaneous SCC and precancerous lesions, a feature of UV-induced carcinogenesis (7\\u20139). However, p53 is mutated in only a small proportion of melanomas (20\\u201322). The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer (23). Other studies have described PTEN loss or mutation in cancer specimens, cancer cell lines, and inherited cancer predisposition syndromes (20, 22\\u201328). We hypothesized that analysis of base substitution mutations in this gene in melanomas from XP patients could provide evidence for UV induction of the mutations and thereby demonstrate a role of UV in causation of melanomas.  Go to: RESULTS Melanomas and Mutations. We studied melanomas from XP patients who were examined at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center from 1971 to 2008. Pigmented lesions in the patients were evaluated clinically (Fig. 1A). Lesions in patients seen recently were evaluated by dermatoscopy, a technique that increases melanoma detection by use of detailed examination of magnified pigmented lesions (29) (Fig. 1B). Melanoma samples were processed, diagnosed, and archived by the National Cancer Institute Laboratory of Pathology. After pathological diagnosis, additional histological sections were prepared for use in laser capture microdissection (Fig. 1 C-F). Melan-A immunohistochemistry (30) was used to localize the tumor cells (Fig. 1D).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Melanoma identification and laser capture microdissection of melanoma cells. (A) A pigmented lesion on the left upper arm of a 52-year-old XP patient, XP295BE, showing the melanoma features of asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, and large ... We studied 59 melanomas from 8 XP patients (5 females and 3 males) ranging in age from 28 to 63 years (Table 1). There were 47 MIS, the earliest lesion that can be histologically identified as melanoma, and 12 invasive melanomas (IM). Table 2 summarizes the pathological and mutational features of all melanoma samples. None were metastatic. The anatomic distribution of XP melanomas in our series was similar to the distribution in the U.S. general population, in agreement with a previous report (13). Of the 59 melanomas 54% were on the lower extremity, 19% on the face or scalp, 14% on the upper extremities and 14% on the shoulder or back. There were no melanomas on the palms or soles (Table S1). Fifty-six percent (33) of the melanomas had PTEN mutations and 91% (30) of the melanomas with mutations had UV type mutations occurring at dipyrimidine sites (Tables 1 and \\u200band2).2). PTEN mutations were found in 57% (27) of the MIS.  Table 1. Table 1. XP patients, melanomas, and PTEN mutations Table 2. Table 2. Characteristics of 33 XP melanomas with PTEN mutations High Frequency of UV-Type Mutations. We found 54 PTEN base substitution mutations in the 33 melanomas (Tables 1 and \\u200band2).2). Forty-two percent (14) of the melanomas with PTEN mutations showed more than one mutation, a feature of UV mutagenesis in tumors (7, 9) and in UV-treated plasmids (18). Eight melanomas had 2 mutations, 5 melanomas showed 3 mutations, and 1 carried 4 mutations (Table S2). Among these 54 mutations 89% were UV type mutations occurring at adjacent pyrimidines. This frequency of mutations at dipyrimidines is significantly greater (P < 0.0001) than that predicted by random mutagenesis based on the frequency of dipyrimidines in the PTEN region sequenced (Table 3). Forty-eight of the mutations were UV type occurring at adjacent pyrimidines, and 6 were non-UV type (Tables 2 and \\u200band3).3). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (32) was found in 48% of the 33 melanomas with PTEN mutations. All of these melanomas had UV type mutations. There was a predominance of transition type base substitution mutations (85%) (Table 4), a feature of UV mutagenesis (17, 33). The equal frequency of G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C mutations is different from what was previously reported in studies of non-melanoma skin cancers in XP and non-XP patients (7\\u20139) and in UV-treated plasmids (33) where G:C to A:T mutations predominated. The observed equal frequency of C to T and T to C transitions is suggestive of the mutation spectrum described for the HPRT gene in UV-treated human or mouse cells lacking error prone polymerase eta (31, 34). Of the 6 non-UV mutations (at alternating pyrimidines and purines) 5 involved A:T base pairs and 4 resulted in A:T to G:C mutations (Table 2). Oxidative damage has been reported to produce lesions such as cycloadenines which are poorly repaired by XP cells (35) and might result in mutagenic lesions at A:T base pairs.  Table 3. Table 3. Frequency of UV type base substitution mutations in PTEN gene in melanomas compared to internal tumors Table 4. Table 4. Types of PTEN mutations and alterations of amino acids in XP melanomas Location and Effect of PTEN Mutations. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of mutations in the cDNA and protein domains of PTEN. In our study, 52 base substitution PTEN mutations were located in 8 of the 9 exons. Overall, 37 (69%) of the base substitution mutations resulted in changes of amino acids; these were found for all classes of mutations (Table 4). Inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene would be expected to result from the 2 nonsense mutations (p.Y16X and p.G230X) and the 2 splice mutations (Table 2). Thirty-one UV type and 2 non-UV type base substitutions resulted in missense mutations (Tables 2 and \\u200band4).4). Four missense mutations occurred more than once (c.131G>A; c.283C>T; c.292C>T; and c.901G>A). Twenty-seven of these missense mutations were located inside the phosphatase and C2 calcium/lipid-binding domains of PTEN protein. Of the 33 melanomas with PTEN mutations, 25 (76%) had one or more changed amino acid (Table 2). There were 17 synonymous (silent) base substitution mutations (13 UV type and 4 non-UV type) that would not be expected to alter PTEN function, 8 of these were present in melanomas that also had one or more missense mutations that could affect PTEN function (Table 2).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Location of PTEN mutations in melanomas and effect of mutations on PTEN function. (A) Sites of 52 PTEN cDNA base substitution mutations found in 33 melanomas from 8 XP patients. The 9 exons of the 1212 bp PTEN cDNA are indicated. Mutated bases are numbered. ... PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor through its lipid phosphatase function (36), and it is responsible for phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) dephosphorylation and clearance. This process is required to antagonize the PI3K-dependent activation of Akt (37) and is a prognostic marker for melanoma progression (38). To determine the effect of missense mutations on PTEN function, we investigated the phosphorylation of Akt in cells lacking PTEN. We selected isolated PTEN mutations that occurred in association with LOH (Table 2 and Fig. 2 A and B). We transfected the cells with expression vectors for 6 UV type missense mutants and a wild type control. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of wild-type PTEN dramatically reduced the level of Serine 473 Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 8). In contrast, expression of the PTEN p.F154L, p.L325F, and p.P95S (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 4 and 5) mutants did not reduce AKT phosphorylation to the same extent indicating that these mutations impaired PTEN function. Two of these mutations (p.P95S and p.F154L) were previously reported to be associated with cancers (24, 39) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, PTEN mutants p.Q110R, p.D301N, and p.S362L reduced AKT phosphorylation to a similar extent as wild-type PTEN (Fig. 2C, lanes 6, 9 and 10) indicating that these mutations did not alter this PTEN function.  Go to: DISCUSSION Because XP patients have defective DNA repair, UV damage more frequently leads to mutations, and therefore it is easier to detect their consequences in a shorter time and with fewer patients than in the general population (4, 17, 19). In this study, we found UV type mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, a gene that is a key regulator of carcinogenesis (20, 22\\u201328, 36), providing direct molecular evidence of UV involvement in melanoma induction in humans.  Tumor suppressor genes lead to cancer by being inactivated in contrast to oncogenes, where mutations must cause activation to cause cancer. Since a wider range of mutations can inactivate genes, an effect of UV on tumor suppressors can be more easily detected compared to mutations that activate oncogenes. The PTEN tumor suppressor is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer (23) and PTEN mutations have been detected in up to 40% of cutaneous melanoma cell lines (20, 22, 40). While many prior studies looked for deletions, promoter methylations and immunohistochemical evidence of PTEN inactivation (41\\u201344), we looked for and found base substitution mutations as an indicator of UV damage.  Evidence for UV as Cause of Mutations. If the dipyrimidine (UV type) base substitution mutations that we observed had occurred randomly, they would be expected to occur at the same frequency (54%) as the dipyrimidine sites present in the PTEN gene. However, we found mutations in XP melanomas to occur at dipyrimidines at a significantly greater frequency (89%, P < 0.0001) (Table 3), a feature characteristic of UV mutagenesis. The frequency of UV type mutations (occurring at dipyrimidines) in XP melanomas (89%) was similar to that in non-XP melanomas (87%) (22) (Table 3) indicating that the role of UV in inducing melanomas is similar in both. In contrast, the overall frequency of PTEN base substitution mutations in exons in the non-XP melanomas was 6% (23/381\\u2014including primary, metastatic, and cultured melanomas) (40, 45\\u201351). This is about 10-fold lower than the 56% we found in the primary XP melanomas (Table 1), probably reflecting the UV hypermutability of XP cells (17) and the 1000-fold increase in melanoma frequency in XP patients (13, 52). We did not perform DNA sequencing of the PTEN introns in the XP melanomas, and thus it is possible that there were additional mutations in the introns as reported in non-XP melanomas (49).  The frequency of dipyrimidine mutations in internal tumors in non-UV-exposed sites such as endometrium cancers (48%) and central nervous system cancers (63%) was significantly lower than that in XP or non-XP melanomas and was similar to that predicted by random mutations (54%) (Table 3), thus showing a large contrast between internal tumors and melanomas.  Loss of heterozygosity in a cell represents the loss of one allele of a gene. It is a common occurrence in cancer where it indicates selection related to the absence of a functional tumor suppressor gene in the lost region (32). We found 48% of the melanomas with PTEN mutations had LOH. All of the XP melanomas with LOH had UV type mutations in the remaining allele (88% with missense mutations) indicating a major role of UV in induction of these melanomas.  The occurrence of multiple mutations in a single gene is another feature of UV mutagenesis. Multiple mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were common in human sunlight-related skin tumors in normal (8, 9) and XP patients (7). We found 42% (14) of the 33 XP melanomas with PTEN mutations had as many as 4 different mutations (Table S2). In 6 of the XP melanomas, all of the 200\\u2013300 cells removed by laser capture microdissection came from a single microscopic nest of tumor cells and had 2, 3, or 4 mutations, thus suggesting that they were derived from a single clone with multiple mutations. However, it is possible that molecular heterogeneity was present within a single microscopic nest of melanoma cells. The number of PTEN base substitution mutations per melanoma is consistent with a Poisson distribution (Fig. 2D), suggesting that these mutations accumulated randomly at sites of unrepaired UV damage. Seven of the XP melanomas had one or more mutations that altered amino acids in association with one or more silent mutations (Table 2). It is likely that the amino acid altering mutations accumulated and provided positive selection which would account for the persistence of the silent mutations. In contrast to these skin melanomas, multiple mutations were very rarely reported in PTEN in internal (UV-protected) tumors (4% of 503 central nervous system and 13% of 512 endometrial cancers) (22).  The tumor suppressor functions of PTEN are thought to be mediated by maintaining downstream Akt in a dephosphorylated state (36); however, other functions have been proposed (23, 37, 53). The 2 nonsense and 2 splice mutations in the PTEN gene in the XP melanomas (Table 2) are very disruptive and would be expected to impair protein function. We found 33 missense mutations and many of these were UV type mutations within exons 5 and 8 that control phosphatase activity and protein turnover, respectively. To determine if the missense mutations altered PTEN function, 6 PTEN missense mutations were analyzed in an in vitro assay for the ability to inhibit the activation of the proto-oncogene Akt, one of the downstream activities of PTEN (36). In 3 of these, the ability of PTEN mutant protein to inhibit the activation of Akt was impaired, demonstrating functional impairment of PTEN. Two of these mutations have previously been reported in other cancers (24, 39). The missense mutations may also alter other PTEN functions (23, 37, 53).  UV Type PTEN Mutations in Melanomas in XP and in the General Population. We found that different melanomas in the same patient may have different PTEN mutations (Table 2), indicating that each melanoma arose independently. The importance of these mutations in the pathogenesis of the melanomas is indicated by the finding that PTEN mutations were present in 57% of 47 MIS, signifying that PTEN mutation occurs at an early stage in melanoma induction. Furthermore, 52% of the MIS with PTEN mutations also had LOH indicating absence of the normal allele and suggesting a functional role for those mutations. Finding these UV type mutations in early melanomas in association with functional impairment of PTEN substantiates the direct role of UV in the development of melanomas in XP patients. The similarity in anatomic site distribution (13) and predominance of UV type base substitution PTEN mutations (Table 3) in XP melanomas and melanomas in the general population indicates a similar role for UV induction in both, although the overall mutation rate is much greater in the XP patients. Direct molecular evidence of UV type mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene provides a clear mechanistic framework for the role of UV in the induction of melanomas and a sound rationale for UV protective measures for melanoma prevention.  Go to: METHODS We studied XP patients from 1971 to 2008 at the NIH Clinical Center under protocols approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board. The patients provided informed consent. Laser-capture microdissection was performed by use of an Arcturus PixCell II microscope (Arcturus Engineering) to separate melanoma cells from normal cells. About 300 cells were collected on CapSure LCM Caps (Arcturus Engineering) in each case from serial tissue sections. DNA was extracted using PicoPure DNA Extraction Kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Arcturus Engineering). Genomic DNA from each patient's cultured fibroblasts was analyzed as a control.  All 9 exons of the PTEN gene were amplified as described (54). The PCR products were treated with 0.5 U shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega) and 5 U exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) and both strands were sequenced directly using a Prism Model 3700 Capillary Array sequencer and Big Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems).  We compared the mutations of PTEN in the XP melanomas to mutations in non-XP melanomas, cancers of endometrium, and cancers of the central nervous system listed in the Sanger COSMIC database (22). The Fisher's exact test was applied to compare frequency of the UV type mutations (located at adjacent pyrimidines on either strand) in the cancers to the frequency of adjacent pyrimidines on either strand in the regions of the PTEN gene sequenced.  The effect of mutations identified in the PTEN gene was examined as described (55), except we used the PTEN-null cell line NCI-H1155 (56) and expression vectors for Glu-Glu-tagged PTEN wild-type cDNA and HA-tagged AKT wild-type cDNA in pCMV5. Mutations in PTEN cDNA were introduced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). We used EzviewTM Red Anti-HA Affinity Gel (Sigma), antiphospho-active-PKB/Akt (Ser-473) antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-PKB/Akt (Cell Signaling) and anti-PTEN antibodies (Cell Signaling) in immunoblotting experiments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n
