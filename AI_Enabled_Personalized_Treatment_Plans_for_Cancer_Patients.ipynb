We therefore investigated the correlation of FOXA1 expression with clinical parameters, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival, and hormone receptor expression in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients at different disease stages. FOXA1 expression did not differ significantly between benign glands from the peripheral zone and primary peripheral zone prostate carcinomas. However, FOXA1 was overexpressed in metastases and particularly in castration-resistant cases, but was expressed at lower levels in both normal and neoplastic transitional zone tissues. FOXA1 levels correlated with higher pT stages and Gleason scores, as well as with androgen (AR) and estrogen receptor expression. Moreover, FOXA1 overexpression was associated with faster biochemical disease progression, which was pronounced in patients with low AR levels. Finally, siRNA-based knockdown of FOXA1 induced decreased cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, in vitro tumorigenicity was inducible by ARs only in the presence of FOXA1, substantiating a functional cooperation between FOXA1 and AR. In conclusion, FOXA1 expression is associated with tumor progression, dedifferentiation of prostate cancer cells, and poorer prognosis, as well as with cellular proliferation and migration and with AR signaling. These findings suggest FOXA1 overexpression as a novel mechanism inducing castration resistance in prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor in men in more developed countries,1 ;  2 and the molecular background of its tumor progression is still incompletely understood. Most prostate carcinomas require androgen stimulation to grow, and for nearly 70 years androgen ablation therapy has been one of the central therapeutic strategies against advanced prostate cancer.3 Although most tumors initially respond to this therapy, some will become resistant and progress to castration-resistant (CRPC) disease. CRPC clinically tends to progress more rapidly than earlier disease manifestations. Although novel chemotherapeutic agents have found wide acceptance in uro-oncological practice in recent years, a large proportion of patients with CRPC show only limited or no response to these therapies. The underlying molecular biology of CRPC is highly complex, and numerous mechanisms have been proposed that promote and retain androgen independence.4 Increased AR function/expression is one of the most important mechanisms in this context. Prostate cancer cells with high levels of AR expression are thought to survive androgen depletion and then are able to convert the disease into the hormone-refractory stage (CRPC).5 However, none of these proposed mechanisms have achieved therapeutic utility, and the analysis of new mechanisms of androgen independence remains of paramount importance. Prognostic markers that herald increased propensities of tumors to become hormone refractory earlier are also needed.  In a previous study, we conducted an array-based transcript analysis of normal prostate tissue and matched cancer tissue to identify differentially expressed genes as candidates for further research, and forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) was among the top up-regulated genes in prostate cancer tissue.6 FOXA1 was originally detected in nuclear extracts of rat liver and hepatoma (HepG2) cells and was named hepatocyte nuclear factor 3\\u03b1 (HNF-3\\u03b1).7; 8 ;  9 After analyses of the Drosophila forkhead gene, FOXA1 became the first identified member of the family of forkhead box transcription factors in vertebrates. 10 Forkhead transcription factors are structurally characterized by a winged helix three-dimensional structure similar to that of linker histones.11 This enables FOX proteins to open highly compacted chromatin12 and so to facilitate the binding of other transcription factors, which prompted researchers to give this class of proteins the name \\u201cpioneer factors.\\u201d  FOXA1 functionally promotes estrogen (ER)13 ;  14 and androgen receptor (AR),15; 16; 17; 18 ;  19 among others. FOXA1 is found in various organs, including respiratory (lung), gastrointestinal (liver, pancreas, colon), and urogenital tract (bladder, prostate); it is also found in the breast. It can bind to the promoters of more than 100 genes and regulates metabolic processes, cell signaling, and the cell cycle.20 During embryogenesis, FOXA1 appears to be important in organogenesis of prostate, lung, liver, and pancreas.15; 21; 22 ;  23 In the adult organism, FOXA1 may be centrally involved in glucose homeostasis; FOXA1 knockout mice die soon after birth, because of hypoglycemia.24 Even after more than 20 years of FOXA1 research, the broad spectrum of FOXA1-related functions in physiological conditions is only incompletely understood. Nonetheless, a growing body of literature attests to the importance of FOXA1 in human neoplasia. The role of FOXA1 has been studied in tumors of breast, prostate, esophagus, and lung. Gene amplification and protein overexpression were observed in Barrett's and lung adenocarcinomas.25 ;  26 FOXA1 has been most extensively studied in breast cancer; a favorable prognosis is related to high FOXA1 levels,20; 27; 28 ;  29 and there is a strong correlation between FOXA1 expression and luminal type A.29  To date, gene amplification and overexpression of FOXA1 protein have been observed in tumors of esophagus, lung, and breast.20; 25; 26; 27 ;  28 No overexpression was revealed in a small study on prostate cancer.30 Because FOXA1 is involved in androgen and estrogen signaling, a close analysis of FOXA1 in prostate carcinomas of various stages and its clinical and prognostic significance including correlations with AR and ER expression is of particular interest. This was our objective with the present study, in which expression data were complemented by experimental analyses, to unravel the functional role of FOXA1 in prostate cell line models.  We studied a large cohort of normal and cancerous prostate tissues (n = 324) to correlate FOXA1 expression with other prognostic parameters, relapse-free survival, and AR and ER expression. We demonstrated differential expression of FOXA1 in normal tissue, depending on the zonal origin, as well as a continuous up-regulation of FOXA1 during prostate cancer progression and an association with shorter relapse-free survival. Additionally, we revealed a close correlation between FOXA1 and hormone receptor expression. Furthermore, siRNA-based transient gene knockdown of FOXA1 led to a reduced cell proliferation and migration rate in prostate cancer cell lines. Finally, we determined that full in vitro tumorigenicity of the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP is dependent on androgen stimulation as well as on FOXA1 expression. Thus, we have established for the first time a tumor-promoting function of FOXA1 in prostate cancer.  Materials and Methods Patients and Tissue Microarray Construction  The initial study population was 529 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection, or resection of organ metastasis between 1993 and 2006 at the Department of Urology of the University Hospital of Zurich because of either prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as described previously.31; 32 ;  33 In this study, only those cases were included that were evaluable for FOXA1 staining (n = 288). Within this group, the distribution of specimen materials was as follows: primary carcinomas (radical prostatectomy specimens; n = 207), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; n = 27), lymph node and distant metastases (n = 39), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; n = 15). Patient age among primary carcinomas ranged between 46 and 75 years (median, 65 years). Preoperative PSA levels ranged from 0.4 to 357 ng/mL (median, 11.1 ng/mL). Gleason scores in the primary prostate cancer cohort were distributed as follows: 35 (16.9%) cases with Gleason score 2 to 6, 119 (57.5%) cases with Gleason score 7, and 53 (25.6%) cases with Gleason score 8 to 10. The corresponding pT categories were 129 (62.3%) cases at pT2 and 78 (37.7%) cases at pT3/4. Margins were clear (R0) in 131 (63.9%) cases; the others had evidence of tumor at the inked margins (R1).  Follow-up data were obtained for the group of primary carcinomas after radical prostatectomy. In this group, 92 patients (44.4%) experienced a biochemical (PSA) relapse after a median time of 24 months, defined as a rising PSA level exceeding 0.1 ng/mL, from a nadir after surgery. The median follow-up time for these patients was 60 months.  A tissue microarray (TMA) from these cases was constructed as described previously.32 Additionally, 23 cases of CRPC transurethrally resected for palliation were included, along with 1 bone trephine of a CRPC metastasis and 12 prostatectomy specimens with transitional zone carcinomas and benign prostate hyperplasia from the archives of the Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital Zurich. The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich (approval number StV 25-2007).  Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence Staining and Analysis  The TMA blocks were freshly cut (3 \\u03bcm thick) and mounted on SuperFrost slides (Menzel Gl\\u00e4ser, Braunschweig, Germany). Immunohistochemistry was conducted with a Benchmark automated staining system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) using Ventana reagents for the entire procedure. Primary antibodies (FOXA1: anti-HNF3\\u03b1/\\u03b2, clone C-20, dilution 1:400 in a Bond diluent, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA; AR: anti-androgen receptor, clone F39.4.1, dilution 1:500 in a Bond diluent, BioGenex, San Ramon, CA; ER\\u03b1: anti-estrogen receptor, clone SP1, prediluted in Ventana diluent, Ventana Medical Systems; ER\\u03b2: anti-human estrogen receptor \\u03b22, clone 57/3, dilution 1:200 in bovine serum albumin/Tris, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK; PSA: anti-human prostate-specific antigen, dilution 1:4000 in Ventana diluent, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; Ki-67: anti-Ki-67 antigen, clone MIB-1, dilution 1:20 in Ventana diluent, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; cyclin D1: anti-cyclin D1, clone SP4, dilution 1:40 in Ventana diluent, Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA; and p27: anti-p27, clone C-19, dilution 1:30, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were detected with an UltraVIEW DAB detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) using Benchmark CC1m heat-induced epitope retrieval. The signal was further enhanced with the Ventana amplification kit. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Immunofluorescence double stainings were performed as described previously,34 using the same antibodies as for immunohistochemistry.  Evaluation of the stained TMAs was done by two pathologists (M.M. and G.K.) simultaneously on a multiheaded microscope. Evaluation of nuclear staining intensities for FOXA1, AR, ER\\u03b1/\\u03b2, and p27 and the cytoplasmic staining intensity for PSA was evaluated according to a four-tiered scale: 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate), and 3+ (strong). For examples of FOXA1 staining, see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org. The proliferation index of tumors was estimated as the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells, and cyclin D1 expression was quantified as the percentage of positive cells.  Cell Culture  PC-3 and DU-145 cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and LNCaP cells from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were cultivated in Ham's F-12 medium with Kaighn's modification, Eagle's minimal essential medium, and RPMI-1640 medium, respectively, each supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RWPE-1 cells (ATCC) were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium mixed with bovine pituitary extract and human recombinant epidermal growth factor (medium and supplements from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All cell lines were cultured at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity.  RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR  RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by cDNA synthesis applying a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed on the 7900HT fast real-time PCR System using TaqMan master mix (both from Applied Biosystems) and the Universal Probe Library (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (FOXA1: forward primer 5\\u2032AGGGCTGGATGGTATTG3\\u2032, reverse primer 5\\u2032-ACCGGGACGGAGGAGTAG-3\\u2032, probe #1; PSA: forward primer 5\\u2032CCCACTGCATCAGGAACA3\\u2032, reverse primer 5\\u2032-ATATCGTAGAGCGGGTGTGG-3\\u2032, probe #5; and AGR2, anterior gradient 2: forward primer 5\\u2032-GGTGGGTGAGGAAATCCAG-3\\u2032, reverse primer 5\\u2032-GTAGGAGAGGGCCACAAGG-3\\u2032, probe #47). Gene expression was normalized to ALAS1, which is stably expressed in prostate cancer cells. 35 (forward primer 5\\u2032-TAATGACTACCTAGGAATGAGTCG-3\\u2032, reverse primer 5\\u2032-CCATGTTGTTTCAAAGTGTCCA-3\\u2032, probe #43, from Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland).  Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis  Cells were lysed in 60 mmol/L n-octyl-\\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in the presence of protease inhibitors (complete, mini, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor cocktail tablets; Roche Applied Science). Cleared lysates (20 \\u03bcg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween buffer, membranes were probed with primary antibodies (FOXA1: clone C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; cyclin D1: clone 72-13G, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; p27: clone C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; and actin: MAB1501, Millipore, Billerica, MA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), incubation, and detection via Pierce SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Thermo Scientific).  SiRNA Transfection for Transient Gene Knockdown  Generally, LNCaP cells were transfected immediately after seeding using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the FastForward protocol provided by the manufacturer. PC-3 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent. Cells were transfected at the day of seeding with a final siRNA concentration of 10 nmol/L (target sequences: nonspecific 5\\u2032-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3\\u2032; FOXA1 siRNA #1 5\\u2032-CCAGACGGGTTTCATTATTAT-3\\u2032; FOXA1 siRNA #2 5\\u2032-CAAACCGTCAACAGCATAATA-3\\u2032; and FOXA1 siRNA #3 5\\u2032-CTCCTCCGTCCCGGTCAGCAA-3\\u2032, all from Qiagen). At 1 day after transfection, the medium of PC-3 cells was changed. Generally, the transfection mix was prepared in Opti-MEM reduced-serum medium (Invitrogen). During androgen treatment, LNCaP cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000, as described for the PC-3 cells. Phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) was used to prepare the transfection mix and no medium was changed. Knockdown efficiency was confirmed on the RNA and protein levels using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively.  DNA Synthesis Rate  The DNA synthesis rate was measured based on bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into newly synthesized DNA strands by applying a cell proliferation ELISA BrdU kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates; after 6 hours, BrdU labeling reagent was added to the medium, and cells were incubated at 37\\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, cells were fixed and stained with an anti-BrdU antibody, which was detected with substrate solution. The color reaction was stopped by adding sulfuric acid, and optical density was measured at 450 nm and at 595 nm as reference wavelength.  Transmigration Assay  Haptotactic cell migration was analyzed in Transwell chambers (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA) that were coated at the bottom with 10 \\u03bcg/mL fibronectin (Roche Applied Science) for 2 hours at room temperature. The lower chamber was filled with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were seeded in the upper chamber in the same medium. After 24 hours incubation at 37\\u00b0C, nonmigrated cells were removed with a cotton swab, and the remaining cells were fixed with methanol/acetic acid and stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired at nine defined locations on the membrane and were analyzed with ImageJ software, version 1.4 (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The migration rate was quantified by determining the area of the membrane that was covered with stained nuclei.  Scratch Wound Assay  Cells were seeded in 6-cm cell culture plates and grown to 95% confluency, before they were transfected with siRNAs. A wound was introduced into the cell monolayer using a pipette tip and images were acquired every 24 hours. The area of the wound was measured using ImageJ 1.4 software.  Cell Cycle Analysis  Cells were detached, washed twice with sample buffer (1% glucose in PBS), and fixed with ethanol overnight at 4\\u00b0C. The next day, cells were incubated with 50 \\u03bcg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3 mg/mL RNase A (Qiagen) and 0.05% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in sample buffer and then were analyzed by flow cytometry. The proportion of cells in G1, S, and G2 phases was determined applying the Dean/Jett/Fox model provided with the FlowJo version 6.3 software package (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon).  Androgen Treatment  LNCaP cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red, supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). After 48 hours, dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in ethanol was added, to a final concentration of 100 nmol/L.  Statistical Analysis  For analysis of the association of staining intensity with clinicopathological parameters, descriptive statistics were used (cross tables, two-tailed Fisher's exact test, and two-tailed \\u03c72 test). For correlation significance, Spearman's \\u03c1 test (two-tailed) was used. Univariate survival analyses were conducted according to the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. These statistics were calculated with SPSS statistical software, version 19 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Cell culture results are expressed as means \\u00b1 SD. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and significance was tested in a two-tailed paired or unpaired t-test, if necessary with Welch's correction, depending on the data set. Significance was set at P < 0.05.  Results Immunohistochemistry of FOXA1  FOXA1 was found nearly exclusively in nuclei of epithelial cells; no stromal immunoreactivity was observed, neither in normal nor in tumor tissues. In cases with strong FOXA1 expression, a mild degree of additional cytoplasmic staining was noted but not recorded. In normal prostatic tissues from the peripheral zone (PZ) close to the tumor (adjacent normal; n = 204), the distribution of FOXA1 expression scores was as follows: 3 (1.5%) cases negative, 42 (20.6%) cases 1+, 146 (71.6%) cases 2+, and 13 (6.4%) cases 3+. The mean expression score of FOXA1 in normal tissue of the PZ was 1.8 ( Figure 1A). FOXA1 was found in secretory cells; basal cells were either negative or only weakly and inconsistently positive. In contrast, hyperplastic normal tissues from the transitional zone (TZ; n = 15) showed less FOXA1 positivity (mean, 0.67): 7 (46.7%) cases negative, 6 (40%) cases 1+, and 2 (13%) cases 2+; in no case did tissues score 3+ (0%) ( Figure 1B).

Figure options The differential expression of FOXA1 in normal tissues from PZ and TZ prompted us to differentiate tumors from both zones in the analysis. In primary carcinomas from the PZ (Figure 1C), the distribution of FOXA1 expression scores was as follows: 22 (10.6%) cases negative, 56 (27.1%) cases 1+, 114 (55.1%) cases 2+, and 15 (7.2%) cases 3+. The mean expression score of FOXA1 in primary carcinomas of the PZ was 1.59. Of 12 TZ carcinomas, 11 were FOXA1-negative (Figure 1D) and 1 was weakly positive (mean expression, 0.08). Of these 12 cases, 7 had a coexisting PZ carcinoma (Figure 1, C and D) with significantly higher levels of FOXA1 (mean expression, 1.71; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.016). In metastases, the distribution of FOXA1 expression scores was as follows: 7 (17.9%) cases negative, 4 (10.3%) cases 1+, 10 (25.6%) cases 2+, and 18 (46.2%) cases 3+. The mean expression score of FOXA1 in metastases was 2.0 ( Figure 1E). In CRPC, the distribution of FOXA1 expression scores was as follows: 2 (3.9%) cases negative, 2 (3.9%) cases 1+, 23 (45.1%) cases 2+, and 24 (47.1%) cases 3+. The mean expression score of FOXA1 in CRPC was 2.35 (Figure 1F).  In summary, we saw little differences between normal tissue of the peripheral zone and peripheral zone cancer tissue, although a tendency to slightly decreased FOXA1 levels in cancer was observed. Significant up-regulation of FOXA1 was seen in metastases, which was more pronounced in CRPC. Surprisingly, normal or hyperplastic tissues from the transitional zone as well as carcinomas stemming from this region showed markedly and significantly lower FOXA1 expression levels (Table 1 and Figure 2).

Figure options Hormone Receptor Expression in BPH, Primary Carcinomas, Metastases, and CRPC  To elucidate the relationship of FOXA1 expression to steroid hormone receptors, we evaluated epithelial and stromal immunoreactivity of AR, estrogen receptor alpha (ER\\u03b1), and ER\\u03b2 in BPH, primary carcinomas, metastases, and CRPC (TMA-based). The mean expression (as staining intensity) of these receptors in relation to FOXA1 and PSA is shown in Figure 3. The most striking findings during tumor progression were up-regulation of FOXA1 and ER\\u03b2 (in epithelium and stroma) and down-regulation of stromal AR and PSA. Expression of AR was steeply increased from primary carcinomas to metastases, and then decreased toward the hormone refractory state of CRPC.

Mean staining intensity of FOXA1, androgen (AR) and estrogen receptors (ER), and PSA in the different patient subgroups. Figure options Relationship of FOXA1 to Clinicopathological and Molecular Parameters  In primary carcinomas, FOXA1 expression was significantly associated with pT stage and Gleason score (Table 2). FOXA1 was further significantly correlated with epithelial AR (\\u03c1 = 0.534, P < 0.001), stromal AR (\\u03c1 = 0.213, P = 0.002), stromal ER\\u03b1 (\\u03c1 = 0.444, P < 0.001), epithelial ER\\u03b2 (\\u03c1 = 0.41, P < 0.001), and stromal ER\\u03b2 (\\u03c1 = 0.354, P < 0.001). No correlation with PSA expression or Ki-67 proliferation index was found. Other interdependencies are given in Supplemental Table S1 (available at http://ajp.amjpathol.org.)  Table 2.

Table options The strong correlation of FOXA1 with epithelial AR prompted us to conduct a double immunofluorescence study of these two markers in a small subset of cases, which demonstrated an excellent concordance of immunoreactivity of both markers (Figure 4).  Double immunofluorescence of FOXA1 and AR in human prostate cancer. Original ... Figure 4.  Double immunofluorescence of FOXA1 and AR in human prostate cancer. Original magnification, \\u00d7400. Figure options Survival Analyses  The analysis of patient follow-up data on serum PSA levels revealed a significant association between high FOXA1 expression levels and shorter relapse-free survival times in Kaplan-Meier analysis (mean, 87 versus 70 months; P = 0.018; Figure 5A). However, FOXA1 expression failed to represent an independent prognostic marker (Cox regression analysis, including preoperative PSA level, pT stage, Gleason score, and margin status; data not shown). To clarify whether this prognostic significance is dependent on AR expression, a stratified Kaplan-Meier analysis according to low (0 to 2+) and high (3+) AR levels was performed. This analysis demonstrated an increased prognostic significance of FOXA1 in cases with low AR levels (mean, 86 versus 56 months; P < 0.001); in cases with high AR levels, no prognostic significance at all was discerned ( Figure 5, B and C). Furthermore, in the patient subgroup with low AR levels, FOXA1 expression failed prognostic significance in a multivariate analysis (Cox regression analysis, including preoperative PSA level, pT stage, Gleason score, and margin status; data not shown).  Kaplan-Meier survival curves for FOXA1 expression in patients with primary ... Figure 5.  Kaplan-Meier survival curves for FOXA1 expression in patients with primary carcinomas. A: All patients. B: Patients with low AR levels. C: Patients with high AR levels. Figure options Characterization of FOXA1 Expression in Prostatic Cell Lines  We next sought to test whether FOXA1 overexpression has a functional relevance in prostate cancer cell lines. Expression on the transcript and protein levels was determined in an immortalized prostatic epithelial cell-line (RWPE-1) and in three metastasis-derived prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3). In Western blot analysis, FOXA1 protein was strongly expressed in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, but was undetectable in DU-145 and RWPE-1 cells. mRNA expression was strongest in LNCaP cells. Medium levels of FOXA1 mRNA were detected in PC-3 and DU-145 cells, but levels in RWPE-1 cells were very low (Figure 6A). The discrepancy between FOXA1 mRNA and protein levels in DU-145 and PC-3 cells indicates differential post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression in these cell lines. In light of the strong protein expression of FOXA1, LNCaP and PC-3 cells were chosen for initial tumorigenicity studies. A knockdown protocol based on RNA interference was established for both cell lines. qPCR and Western blot analysis revealed a potent FOXA1 knockdown on the mRNA and the protein level, respectively, 72 hours after transfection of three different siRNAs (Figure 6, B and C).  Characterization of FOXA1 expression in prostatic cell lines. FOXA1 mRNA was ... Figure 6.  Characterization of FOXA1 expression in prostatic cell lines. FOXA1 mRNA was determined by qPCR (top) and protein expression by Western blot analysis (bottom). A: RWPE-1, LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3 cells were cultivated in T75-cell culture flasks until a confluency of 70% to 80%, mRNA expression was normalized to FOXA1 levels in LNCaP cells. 300,000 LNCaP (B) and 200,000 PC-3 cells (C) were seeded into six-well plates, transfected with nonspecific siRNAs (unspec) or siRNAs #1, #2, or #3, and incubated for 72 hours. untr, nontransfected. *P < 0.05 versus cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA. Figure options FOXA1 Knockdown Reduces Cell Proliferation  One of the main characteristics of tumor cells is uncontrolled proliferation.36 To determine whether FOXA1 expression has an influence on prostate cancer cell proliferation, LNCaP and PC-3 cells were transfected with FOXA1-specific siRNAs and cells were counted. Compared with corresponding nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells, the cell number of FOXA1 siRNA #1, #2 and #3 transfected LNCaP cells was reduced significantly (by 24%, 18%, and 20%, respectively). Although siRNA treatment itself strongly affected the propagation of PC-3 cells, the number of cells transfected with FOXA1 siRNA #1, #2 and #3 was further decreased by a respective 32%, 44%, and 36%, compared with control cells (Figure 7, A and B). To test whether the reduction of cell number after FOXA1 knockdown was caused by a reduction of cell proliferation rate, DNA synthesis rate was determined by measuring BrdU incorporation; 44%, 47%, and 29% less BrdU was detected after transfection of LNCaP cells with FOXA1 siRNA #1, #2 and #3, respectively. The DNA synthesis rate of PC-3 cells was decreased by a highly significantly (P < 0.0008) by 18%, 48%, and 28% in cells transfected with FOXA1 siRNA #1, #2, and #3, compared with nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells ( Figure 7, C and D). Taken together, these results show a significant reduction of proliferation of LNCaP and PC-3 cells after FOXA1 knockdown.  Proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines on FOXA1 knockdown. 300,000 LNCaP ... Figure 7.  Proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines on FOXA1 knockdown. 300,000 LNCaP (A) and 200,000 PC-3 cells (B) were seeded in six-well plates, transfected with nonspecific siRNAs (unspec) or siRNAs #1, #2, or #3, and counted after 72 hours. 600,000 LNCaP (C) and 400,000 PC-3 cells (D) were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transfected with siRNAs.

OD, optical density; unspec, nonspecific siRNA; untr, nontransfected; *P < 0.05 versus cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA. Figure options Reduced Cell Proliferation Is Associated with G1 Arrest  The observed reduction of cell proliferation on FOXA1 knockdown involved the question of whether this is reflected in a change of cell cycle distribution. We therefore determined the proportion of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. The proportion of LNCaP cells in G1 phase increased from 65% in control cells to 70% to 75% in FOXA1 knockdown cells, whereas the proportion of cells in S phase declined from 22% in control cells to 15% to 20% in FOXA1 knockdown cells; the proportion of cells in G2/M-phase also decreased slightly, from 13% to 10% (Figure 8, A, C, and E). The differences were even more pronounced in PC-3 cells. Of the cells treated with nonspecific siRNA, 63% were in G1 phase, in contrast to 72% to 81% of the cells treated with FOXA1-specific siRNA #1, #2, and #3. In accord with this \\u226420% of increase of cells in G1 phase, the proportions of cells in S phase decreased in FOXA1 knockdown PC-3 cells from 19% to 6% to 14%, and those in G2/M decreased from 10% to 17% (Figure 8, B, D, and F).

C and D: Representative distribution of G1, S, and G2/M phases. E and F: Proportion of cells in G1 phase from all replicates. *P < 0.05 versus cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA. Figure options To analyze whether G1 arrest is caused by a decrease in cyclin D1 expression or an increase in p27 expression, we measured levels of these two proteins in FOXA1 knockdown cells, as well as in our patient cohort. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of cyclin D1 was clearly reduced in PC-3 cells treated with FOXA1 siRNA #2 and #3, but expression of p27 did not change in these cells (Figure 9). Furthermore, we reanalyzed the expression data of cyclin D1 in our cohort, which we had studied recently.37 Additionally, the TMA slides were stained with an anti-p27 antibody. We found a strong correlation between FOXA1 and cyclin D1 (\\u03c1 = 0.183, P = 0.02) and also p27 (\\u03c1 = 0.295, P < 0.001) in primary prostate carcinomas. In summary, these data clearly show a G1 arrest on FOXA1 knockdown, which is very prominent in PC-3 cells.  Cell cycle regulation in PC-3 cells on FOXA1 knockdown. 400,000 PC-3 cells were ... Figure 9.  Cell cycle regulation in PC-3 cells on FOXA1 knockdown. 400,000 PC-3 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transfected with nonspecific siRNAs (unspec) or siRNAs #1, #2, or #3. After 72 hours, protein expression of FOXA1, cyclin D1, and p27 was determined by Western blot analysis. Figure options Cell Migration Is Inhibited on FOXA1 Knockdown  An elevated migration rate is another important feature of malignant cells.36 The relevance of FOXA1 expression during cell migration was elucidated in a transmigration assay. In particular, migration toward fibronectin was investigated. Down-regulation of FOXA1 reduced migration of LNCaP cells through the porous membrane significantly, by 18%, 12% and 25% for siRNA #1, #2, and #3, compared with control cells. In addition to the nonspecific transfection effect, the FOXA1 siRNA-specific reduction of PC-3 cell migration accounted for 12%, 20%, and 29% for the respective siRNAs #1, #2, and #3, compared with corresponding control cells (Figure 10, A and B). Migration of PC-3 cells on an uncoated surface was assessed in a scratch wound assay, which is less reliably applicable to LNCaP cells, because these cells do not tend to form dense monolayers. The area not covered with migrated PC-3 cells within 24 hours after wounding was 1.9, 2.1, and 1.6 times larger after FOXA1 down-regulation with siRNA #1, #2, and #3, respectively, compared with nonspecific siRNA treatment (Figure 10C), indicating a diminished cell motility. Altogether, these data show that the reduction of FOXA1 expression induces considerable inhibition of LNCaP and PC-3 cell migration.  Migration of prostate cancer cell lines on FOXA1 knockdown. 600,000 LNCaP (A) ... Figure 10.  Migration of prostate cancer cell lines on FOXA1 knockdown. 600,000 LNCaP (A) and 400,000 PC-3 cells (B) were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transfected with nonspecific siRNAs (unspec) or siRNAs #1, #2, or #3.

Figure options Androgen Inducibility of Cell Proliferation and Migration Is Dependent on FOXA1  Because we observed an increased prognostic significance of FOXA1 expression in patients with low AR levels but no prognostic value of FOXA1 expression in patients with high AR levels, we asked whether FOXA1 is important in mediating the androgen response. We therefore reanalyzed the proliferation and migration behavior of FOXA1high and FOXA1low LNCaP cells on androgen treatment. In nontransfected and nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells, DNA synthesis rate was inducible by androgen treatment (fold change = 2.5 and 3.2, respectively). However, in FOXA1 siRNA-treated cells, DHT did not change the cell proliferation rate (Figure 11A). Similarly, the number of transmigrated cells was elevated in nontransfected and nonspecific siRNA-transfected LNCaP cells (fold change = 1.5 and 1.4, respectively). In contrast, the migration rate of FOXA1 siRNA-transfected cells was unaffected by DHT treatment (Figure 11B).  Cell proliferation and migration with androgen treatment in wild-type and FOXA1 ... Figure 11.  Cell proliferation and migration with androgen treatment in wild-type and FOXA1 knockdown LNCaP cells. 1,000,000 cells were seeded in phenol red-free medium with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum in 6-cm dishes and transfected with nonspecific siRNAs (unspec) or siRNAs #1, #2, or #3. After 48 hours, ethanol (EtOH) or DHT was added to cells. Another 24 hours later, 20,000 cells were reseeded in quadruplicate into 96-well plates and the DNA synthesis rate was measured (A) and 50,000 cells were reseeded in triplicate into fibronectin-coated Transwell chambers and a transmigration assay was performed (B). mRNA expression of PSA (C) and AGR2 (D) was determined by qPCR. *P < 0.05. Figure options We further analyzed the expression of known androgen-dependent genes. PSA mRNA levels were strongly inducible by DHT treatment, independent of FOXA1 expression status of LNCaP cells (average fold change = 10.3; Figure 11C). In contrast, expression of AGR2, which has been shown to be stimulated by FOXA1,38 was not inducible by DHT treatment in FOXA1 siRNA-treated LNCaP cells, although its expression was strongly increased in FOXA1 high LNCaP cells (fold change = 3.3 and 5.1; Figure 11D). Thus, proliferation, migration, and AGR2 expression of androgen-dependent cells is inducible by DHT treatment only in the presence of FOXA1.  Discussion A previous study on whole-mount prostatectomy sections from 20 primary prostate carcinomas, which included benign and malignant tissue, revealed a strong expression of FOXA1 in normal tissue and no up-regulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma tissue.30 Similar results were obtained in mouse models of prostate cancer.39 ;  40 However, one study analyzing FOXA1 expression in mouse models indicated a consistent up-regulation of FOXA1 in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate adenocarcinoma.30  Here, we have presented data from a large patient cohort (to our knowledge, the largest yet) for analysis of the role of FOXA1 in prostate tissues, including benign tissues from different prostatic zones and a large set of clinically characterized primary prostate cancer cases, metastases, and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. The main findings are a zonal dependence of FOXA1 expression in normal and tumor tissues, increased FOXA1 levels with tumor progression (with the highest levels in CRPC), a prognostic value in primary tumors, a very strong correlation of FOXA1 with AR and ER, and finally experimental data to endorse the functional relevance of FOXA1 in prostate cancer cell lines.  With our first TMA analysis, we found significantly lower FOXA1 expression in non-neoplastic tissues, compared with prostate cancer tissues, a finding in striking contrast to the data of a previous study revealing no differences between normal and cancerous tissues.30 When we noted a high variability of FOXA1 expression levels in non-neoplastic tissues, we reanalyzed our tissues. It turned out that normal tissues from the transitional zone (TZ), where benign prostate hyperplasia occurs, showed very low levels of FOXA1, but normal tissues from the peripheral zones (PZ) showed levels similar to those of primary carcinomas, which resolves the apparent discrepancy between our current initial analysis and the above-mentioned study. Because primary carcinomas arise mostly in the peripheral zone and show staining intensities similar to the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue from the same zone, we later included 12 prostatectomy specimens with transitional zone carcinomas and noticed very low FOXA1 expression, similar to the expression levels of the adjacent transitional zone glands. This finding suggests a need to analyze the diagnostic validity of FOXA1 loss as a marker for transitional zone differentiation of prostate cancer in further studies, and also emphasizes the importance of more accurately defining the origins of normal tissue for comparative analyses.  Because some degree of BPH can be found in most prostatectomy specimens, BPH tissues are commonly used as benign prostate tissues for research. This was also the case in our previous array-based transcript profiling study of prostate cancer, which revealed FOXA1 mRNA as strongly up-regulated.6 Because the transitional and the peripheral zones of the prostate are known to follow distinctly different regulatory molecular pathways, many findings based on comparison of tissue of both zones might be misleading.41; 42 ;  43 The more appropriate normal tissue to compare to peripheral zone prostate carcinomas should be normal tissue of the very same zone. However, peripheral zone normal tissue is commonly affected by inflammation, atrophy, and preneoplastic lesions, which also explains the popularity of hyperplastic but otherwise morphologically normal-appearing transitional zone tissue from the prostate.  The present study not only extends our knowledge of FOXA1 in normal prostatic tissues, but also offers a more detailed analysis in primary carcinomas, metastases, and especially CRPC, for which previous study has been largely lacking. In primary carcinomas after radical prostatectomy, FOXA1 correlated positively with conventional parameters of tumor progression (ie, higher Gleason scores and higher pT stage). FOXA1 also possessed a limited prognostic relevance, but this was lost in multivariate analyses. This finding is in contrast to the prognostic value of FOXA1 in breast cancer, for which a favorable prognosis has been related to high FOXA1 levels, particularly in ER+ cases.20; 27; 28 ;  29 Prostate cancer metastases and CRPC showed significantly higher levels of FOXA1 than primary carcinomas, further indicating a role of FOXA1 in prostate cancer progression.  We then asked whether FOXA1 influences the behavior of tumor cells in in vitro studies based on RNA interference. FOXA1 knockdown slowed down propagation of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. This slowing was due to a reduced cell proliferation rate caused by an arrest in G1 phase, as demonstrated by DNA synthesis rate measurement and cell cycle analysis. A reduction of the S-phase cell population was also observed in the cell cycle study. These data substantiate an enhanced mitotic activity and stimulation toward proliferation of cancer cells with high FOXA1 levels. FOXA1 has been shown previously to promote expression of the negative cell cycle regulator p27, as well as of the cell cycle promoter cyclin D1, and thus is suggested to balance cell proliferation and maintenance of differentiation. 44 We observed a corresponding correlation between FOXA1 and expression of both p27 and cyclin D1 in our patient cohort. However, on FOXA1 knockdown in PC-3 cells, levels of p27 were unaffected, whereas the expression of cyclin D1 was reduced. The reduction was strongest in the samples with the strongest FOXA1 knockdown, substantiating a direct relationship between expression of FOXA1 and cyclin D1. Thus, in the advanced prostate cancer cell line PC-3, FOXA1 knockdown causes G1 cell cycle arrest via down-regulation of cyclin D1. In human primary carcinomas (represented by our TMA study), cell cycle regulation seems to be more complex. Additionally, a decreased motility of both cell lines on FOXA1 down-regulation was observed in a haptotactic transmigration assay, which could be verified for PC-3 cells in the scratch wound assay. Similar to our present data, strong expression of FOXA1 has been detected in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, which are a model of aggressive (HER2+) breast cancer; in these cells, knockdown of FOXA1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted response to trastuzumab (Herceptin) by induction of apoptosis.45 In contrast, forced expression of FOXA1 in ER+ breast cancer cell lines inhibited clonal growth, and FOXA1 expression levels correlated negatively with growth stimuli.20 These observations indicate different roles of FOXA1 in HER2+ and ER+ breast cancer cells, which explains the partially conflicting data. Our cell culture experiments clearly substantiate the proposed FOXA1 dependency of tumor progression in the prostate. However, the details of FOXA1 and hormone receptor interplay in prostate cancer cells remain to be elucidated.  Steroid hormone receptors are among the best described transcription factors whose activity is enhanced by the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1. In the present study, therefore, AR, ER\\u03b1, and ER\\u03b2 were analyzed in parallel. Close and significant correlation with FOXA1 expression levels in primary carcinomas was found for all three hormone receptors, and was strongest for AR (see Supplemental Table S1 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Furthermore, a subsequent loss of stromal AR expression toward CRPC disease has been observed (Figure 3), which cannot be explained by current knowledge and understanding of the disease. However, a stromal-epithelial interaction (and androgen-mediated induction) in the setting of the development of the organ has been discussed (see review by Bosland46).  A correlation between FOXA1 and ER\\u03b2 has not been reported previously in cells of any tissue. Such a correlation contradicts the current assumption that ER\\u03b2 is the good estrogen receptor in prostate cancer development, because we identified FOXA1 as an unfavorable prognostic factor. However, other recent studies also question this hypothesis. To date, four studies have investigated expression of ER\\u03b2 and association with aggressiveness in human prostate carcinomas. Three studies indicated a general loss of ER\\u03b2 mRNA and/or protein expression in prostate carcinomas,4; 47 ;  48 and one of these revealed up-regulation of ER\\u03b2 in metastases.46 The fourth study indicated decreased expression of ER\\u03b2 in 40% of HGPIN, compared with normal tissue, high expression in hormone-dependent carcinomas and their metastases and again a loss of ER\\u03b2 expression in CRPC.49 Poor prognosis was associated with low4 as well as with high50 ;  51 ER\\u03b2 expression. Two cell culture studies dealing with the role of ER\\u03b2 in prostate cancer cells, however support the theory of ER\\u03b2 being the good guy, as seen from the perspective of the patient. Induction of apoptosis and down-regulation of the fusion protein TMPRSS2:ERG on treatment with ER\\u03b2 agonists have been reported.52 Furthermore, ER\\u03b2 (together with its ligand 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol) maintains the epithelial phenotype and represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Conversely, ER\\u03b2 expression was reduced on epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction by TGF\\u03b2 or hypoxia.53 Analysis of ER\\u03b2 expression in various independent patient cohorts is needed to clarify the role of this steroid hormone receptor in prostate cancer development.  Although a functional relationship between FOXA1 and AR has been described from several previous studies,16; 17; 18 ;  19 no correlation was revealed between the expression values of the two transcription factors. We further verified the coexpression of FOXA1 and AR on the single-cell level by double immunofluorescence. This is the more intriguing, because androgen signaling is the core pathway of prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Moreover, similar to FOXA1, strong AR expression was significantly more often encountered in metastatic and CRPCs than in hormone-sensitive primary tumors (Figure 3), which fits with the observation that amplification of AR occurs more frequently in CRPC than in primary prostate carcinomas.54; 55 ;  56 Nonetheless, the influence of FOXA1 on AR transactivation and androgen-dependent gene expression remains to be elucidated, because conflicting (activating and repressing) properties of FOXA1 on AR-dependent functions have been proposed.15; 16; 18 ;  19  Very recently, during our final work on the present article, Jain et al57 published a smaller immunohistochemical expression study on FOXA1 in primary prostate cancer and prostate cancer metastases and compared FOXA1 to AR levels. Their findings are in line with our present data, showing a correlation of FOXA1 with AR and increased FOXA1 levels in metastases. The authors speculated that FOXA1 might be a prognostic marker for disease progression, although they did not conduct a survival analysis, and their study did not address the clinically most critical prostate cancer subgroup of hormone refractory cases.57  FOXA1 is known to be involved in the recruitment of AR15; 16; 17; 18 ;  19 to the corresponding cis-regulatory elements. Also, FOXA1 binding to androgen-responsive elements independent of androgen concentrations has been reported, as well as a direct physical interaction between FOXA1 and AR. 16; 17; 18 ;  19 Notably, the correlation between strong FOXA1 expression and shorter relapse-free survival was particularly significant in the subgroup of primary prostate carcinomas with low AR expression levels. In contrast, relapse-free survival did not depend on FOXA1 expression levels in the subgroup of carcinomas with high AR levels. These findings might indicate that high AR expression promotes prostate cancer progression in a FOXA1-independent way, whereas in cancers with low AR expression, FOXA1 is needed to maintain AR signaling (as described above) and thus to promote prostate cancer progression. This points to the possibility of elevated androgen sensitivity by up-regulation of AR expression in the AR high-expression subgroup on the one hand and the requirement of FOXA1 to maintain a basal responsiveness of AR to its ligand in the AR low-expression subgroup on the other hand. Such a functional cooperation of FOXA1 and AR on in vitro tumorigenicity has not been analyzed to date. Here, we have clearly demonstrated that the inducibility of LNCaP cell proliferation and migration by androgens is dependent on the presence of FOXA1. This observation was substantiated by synchronous changes in AGR2 mRNA levels, which has been shown to promote migration of LNCaP cells. 38 Moreover, two studies revealed that this gene is regulated by androgens on the one hand58 and by FOXA1 on the other hand.38 Here, we show for the first time that indeed a cooperation of FOXA1 and androgens is needed to induce AGR2 expression.  In summary, the present findings demonstrate that FOXA1 expression increases from primary prostate carcinomas of the peripheral zone and metastases to CRPC, which is reflected by a correlation with higher Gleason scores, higher tumor stages, and faster biochemical disease progression (the last particularly in cases with lower AR levels). Because carcinomas from the TZ showed invariably low FOXA1 expression, a FOXA1-independent development of this subtype of cancer can be assumed. Functionally, a reduced cell proliferation and migration rate was observed on FOXA1 knockdown in androgen-dependent as well as androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. On knockdown of the pioneer transcription factor in androgen-dependent cells, in vitro tumorigenicity was not inducible by androgen treatment. This demonstrates that, in the case of reduced androgen levels (eg, due to hormonal therapy), FOXA1 can amplify androgen signaling and thus promote cell proliferation and migration. Altogether, both our in vivo and our in vitro data suggest that increased FOXA1 levels represent a late event in tumor development, contributing more to tumor progression than to tumor initiation. Therefore, we suggest FOXA1 as a novel mechanism of castration resistance and a novel candidate therapeutic target for CRPC, to be substantiated in further studies.  Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is highly aggressive and is responsible for more than half of thyroid carcinoma deaths, with a median survival of 3 to 6 months from diagnosis. Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy are effective in prolonging ATC patient survival; therefore, alternative systemic treatments for this cancer are urgently needed. FOXA1 is a \\u201cpioneer transcription factor\\u201d overexpressed in some human cancers and involved in estrogen-dependent growth in breast cancer. We found FOXA1 overexpression and gene copy number gain in >70% of ATC. In addition, we show that silencing of FOXA1 leads to the growth arrest of ATC cell lines by reversing its inhibition of p27kip1 transcription. These results suggest that FOXA1 is a potential ATC oncogene and that therapies leading to the down-regulation of FOXA1 could represent a novel therapeutic strategy. Development of FOXA1-directed therapies would be targeted to those tumors harboring FOXA1 copy number gains at 14q21.1.  Malignant tumors of thyroid follicular cells have been classified as either well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, represented by papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, or undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinoma (ATC). Although the majority of either well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas are indolent malignancies with a 10-year survival of up to 90% (1), ATC, which represents \\u223c2% of all thyroid cancers, is one of the most aggressive malignancies known, rapidly invading the neck and often spreading to other organs (2). ATC is thought to develop from an existing papillary or follicular cancer and is responsible for more than half of thyroid carcinoma deaths, with a mean survival of 6 months from diagnosis (3). In fact, neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy are effective to prolong ATC patient survival (4). Therefore, alternative systemic treatment for this cancer are urgently needed.  ATC have a very high proliferation rate and marked aneuploidy (5). Several genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation have been shown to be dysregulated in these tumors (6). In addition, it has been recently reported that thyroid-specific transcription factors crucial for thyroid organogenesis and differentiation, such as Pax8, TTF-1, and TTF-2 (FOXE1), are expressed in thyroid neoplasms (7). In particular, Pax8 is highly expressed in ATC, whereas TTF-1 and FOXE1 were seen in a lower percentage (7).  FOXA factors are members of the winged helix/forkhead box family and play important roles during multiple phases of mammalian life, regulating development of endodermal primordia and organogenesis as well as regulating metabolism and homeostasis in the adult (8\\u201310). In particular, FOXA1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3\\u03b1) is involved in hepatic differentiation and is an endodermal \\u201cpioneer transcription factor,\\u201d binding to promoters and enhancers enabling chromatin access for other tissue-specific transcription factors (11, 12). This transcription factor has been reported as amplified in lung and esophageal cancers (13) and also to be essential for estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells (14, 15). Indeed, FOXA1 is required for estrogen receptor-\\u03b1 recruitment to chromatin, regulation of cyclin D1 expression, and cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells (16, 17). In addition, several other forkhead box subfamilies including FOXO, FOXM, FOXP, and FOXC have been linked to tumorigenesis and the progression of certain cancers, representing direct targets and indirect effectors of therapeutic intervention (18).  In this study, we have investigated FOXA1 expression and copy number in endoderm-derived human thyroid tumors and its functional role in human thyroid carcinoma cell lines.  Materials and Methods  Antibodies  The following antibodies were used: \\u03b2-actin (Sigma), lamin A/C (Cell Signaling Technology), FOXA1 (Ab5089 and Ab23738) for Western blot (Abcam), FOXA1 clone 2F83 for immunohistochemistry and Western blot (Seven Hills Bioreagents), p27kip1 (Transduction Laboratories), cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cell Signaling Technology), cyclin D1 (Thermo Scientific), MIB-1 (DAKO), p21 (BD Pharmingen), and cyclin E1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  Human thyroid cell lines  The human thyroid carcinoma cell lines used in the study were BCPAP and TPC-1 (papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines), WRO82-1 (follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line), and 8505c (undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line). BCPAP were kindly provided by Dr. G. Damante (University of Udine) and WRO cell line was established by Dr. G.F. Juillard (University of California at Los Angeles) and provided by Dr. F. Frasca (University of Catania). TPC-1 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. F. Frasca. 8505c cell line (positive for cytokeratins, markers of epithelial tumors) was established by Dr. M. Akiyama (Radiation Effects Research Foundation). TE4 cell line (esophageal squamous adenocarcinoma) was provided by Dr. H. Ishii (Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School). MCF-7 and MDA-231 (human breast cancer cell lines) were grown as in Eeckhoute et al. (19). All cell lines were grown in RPMI (BCPAP cells were grown in DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS and ampicillin/streptomycin.  Cell transfections  For transfection assays, cells were grown in 60 mm well plates and transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche) in Opti-MEM for 48 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were done at least three times in triplicate to ensure reproducibility of the results.  Short hairpin RNA  To stably suppress FOXA1, we used pLKO.1 lentiviral constructs containing two short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences generated by the RNAi Consortium, sh#1 anti-FOXA1 GCGTACTACCAAGGTGTGTAT and sh#2 anti-FOXA1 GCAGCATAAGCTGGACTTCAA. 8505c cells were also infected with the shRNA anti-GFP control. Lentiviral infections were done as follows. Briefly, 0.5 \\u00d7 106 293T cells were seeded in 60 mm dishes and the day after cotransfected with pLKO.1 lentiviral constructs and packaging plasmids (gag-pol and VSV-G) using Fugene 6 (Roche). The medium containing the progeny virus released from the 293T cells was filtered by 0.45 \\u03bcm filters, collected, and used to infect the 8505c cells for 3 to 6 h in the presence of 8 \\u03bcg/mL polybrene (Sigma). The 8505c cells were incubated for additional 48 h, selected with puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h, and then lysed for Western blotting and real-time PCR analyses. FOXA1 knockdown was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. The experiments were done at least three times in triplicate to ensure reproducibility of the results.  Real-time PCR  RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription-PCR were done as reported from Keeton and Brown (20). We used the following primers: GAAGATGGAAGGGCATGAAA and GCCTGAGTTCATGTTGCTGA for FOXA1, AATAAGGAAGCGACCTGCAA and ATTTGGGGAACCGTCTGAA for p27kip1, CCGAAGTCAGTTCCTTGTGG and CATGGGTTCTGACGGACATC for p21waf1, TGGAGGTCTGCGAGGAACAGAA and TGCAGGCGGCTCTTTTTCA for cyclin D1, and TACCCAAACTCAACGTGCAA and CATGATTTTCCAGACTTCCTCTC for cyclin E1. FOXA1 mRNA expression was normalized to the 40 ribosomal protein S28. The presence of a single amplicon was systemically verified by dissociation curve analysis.  Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation  We used a lysis buffer composed of 1 mol/L HEPES, 5 mol/L NaCl, 1 mol/L MgCl2, glycerol, Triton X-100, and 1 mol/L DTT. We scraped cells and washed twice in cold PBS, added 300 \\u03bcL lysis buffer, and left the cells on ice 5 min, centrifuged the lysate at 2,800 rpm for 1 min at 4\\u00b0C, and collected the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction). We resuspended the pellet in 200 \\u03bcL lysis buffer, added 28 \\u03bcL of 5 mol/L NaCl, and mixed for 1 h at 4\\u00b0C on a nutator, centrifuged the mixture at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\\u00b0C, and collected the supernatant (nuclear fraction).  Immunoblot analysis  Western blot assays were done as in Keeton and Brown (20). Bands were quantified by densitometry with the AlphaEase software (Alpha Innotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Cell cycle analysis and bromodeoxyuridine assay  sh-control, sh#1-FOXA1, and sh#2-FOXA1 8505c cells were seeded at 2 \\u00d7 103 per well in a six-well plate and grown. After 48 h, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) was added to a final concentration of 10 \\u03bcmol/L for 1 h. 8505c cells were trypsinized and fixed in ethanol 75% prechilled (\\u221220\\u00b0C). The pelleted cells at 400 \\u00d7 g at room temperature were resuspended in PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), denatured in 2 mol/L HCl/0.5% BSA for 20 min at room temperature, washed with PBS/0.5% BSA, and centrifuged 5 min at 400 \\u00d7 g at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in 0.1 mol/L sodium borate (pH 8.5) for 2 min at room temperature, washed with PBS/0.5% BSA, centrifuged 5 min at 400 \\u00d7 g at room temperature, and resuspended in a solution PBS 0.5% Tween 20 containing FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated in the dark for 30 min at 37\\u00b0C. Finally, the cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS/0.5% BSA, and resuspended in 500 \\u03bcL of this solution. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 10 \\u03bcg/mL with RNase (10 mg/mL). Cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) exciting at 488 nm and measuring the BrdUrd-FITC on the green fluorescence through a 514 nm bandpass filter and the DNA-linked red fluorescence (propidium iodide) through a 600 nm low pass filter, with compensation to reduce overlap between red and green fluorescence.  Apoptosis assay  Following 48 h sh-control, sh#1-FOXA1, and sh#2-FOXA1 8505c cells were collected and fixed overnight at 4\\u00b0C with 75% ethanol for propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis on a FACSCalibur to evaluate sub-G1 cell populations. Proteins were extracted at the same time point and assayed for cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase expression by Western blot.  Paraffin-embedded thyroid tumors and tissue microarrays  Thyroid tumors were classified according to WHO diagnostic criteria (21). Tissue microarrays were composed from 177 cases: 15 normal thyroid tissues, 30 follicular adenomas, 58 nodular hyperplasia samples, 8 lymphocytic thyroiditis samples, 6 Graves, and 60 differentiated thyroid carcinomas: 48 papillary thyroid carcinomas (31 classic, 13 follicular variant, 3 microcarcinomas, and 1 oxyphilic variant), and 12 follicular thyroid carcinoma. Tissue microarrays were constructed according to previously established procedure (22) from anonymized archival blocks of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the files of the Central Pathology Laboratory at St. James's Hospital, Dublin.  We studied 3 insular thyroid carcinomas and 20 ATC from 20 patients who underwent thyroidectomy (9 males and 11 females; average age, 67.3 \\u00b1 13.9 years; range, 43-93 years).  The ATC cases were screened for TTF-1, thyroglobulin, calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cytokeratins. All the carcinomas displaying extensive immunoreactivity for calcitonin and/or carcinoembryonic antigen (medullary carcinoma) were not included in the series. Finally, all cases were reviewed by four pathologists (G.F., M.L., O.S., and V.N.).  An institutional review board protocol was approved by V.N. for the acquisition of paraffin-embedded thyroid tissue.  Cell pellet processing  After harvesting in PBS, human cancer cell lines were gently spun down (1,200 rpm for 5 min). The PBS was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min to fix them. Following a further PBS wash, the cells were then resuspended in 70% ethanol for 15 min. After aspiration of the ethanol, 2 mL of liquefied Histogel (Richard-Allan Scientific) were added to the cell pellet dropwise. The Histogel was gently vortexed and cooled on ice until solid. Histogel pellets were then processed in a tissue processor in the usual way.  Immunofluorescence  For immunofluorescence experiments, 5 \\u00d7 104 cells were seeded in four-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences) for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, cells were blocked with PBS/1% BSA for 1 h followed by incubation with the primary antibody diluted in PBS/1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then incubated with Texas red anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were washed three times. Finally, the chamber slides were stained with 4\\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged at \\u00d720 with a Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens on an Axioplan 2 Apoptome epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss).  Immunohistochemistry and scoring  Immunohistochemistry was done on 5 \\u03bcm thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue microarray and full sections using a primary antibody for FOXA1, p27kip1, and MIB-1. The primary antibody was diluted 1:100 or 1:200 and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was done for three successive 5 min microwave cycles in EDTA (pH 8). The BioGenex I 6000 autostainer was used for all subsequent steps (BioGenex). Primary antibody was detected using a biotin-avidin-conjugated secondary mouse antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories), horseradish peroxidase and 3,3\\u2032-diaminobenzidine. Counterstaining was with hematoxylin.  Positive controls included human prostate tissues and MCF-7 cell pellets were run with each assay.  Nuclear staining for FOXA1, p27kip1, and MIB-1 was assessed semiquantitatively by using the following scoring methods: (a) quantity: 1, negative; 2, 1% to 10% of examined nuclei positive (low expression); 3, 11% to 50% of nuclei positive; and 4, >50% of nuclei positive (high expression). Scores were averaged across replicate cores. (b) Intensity: 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong.  Positively stained lymphocytes represented the internal control for p27kip1 immunohistochemistry.  Cytogenetic analysis  Slide preparation. Sections (4 \\u03bcm) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were mounted on standard glass slides. Slides were baked at 60\\u00b0C for at least 2 h and soaked for 15 min in xylene at 55\\u00b0C and then in room temperature xylene for 15 min. Slides were dehydrated, air dried, boiled in 100 mmol/L Tris, 50 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.0) for 1 h, and soaked in 2\\u00d7 SSC for 5 min. Slides were placed on a 37\\u00b0C Thermobrite (StatSpin) and treated with Digest-All III solution (Invitrogen) for two 15 min digestions, fixed for 2 min in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, and then dehydrated.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Each BAC DNA (1 \\u03bcg) was labeled using a nick translation kit (Abbott Molecular/Vysis) following the manufacturer's directions. Labeled DNA was precipitated with 5 \\u03bcL Cot-1 DNA (1 mg/mL stock) and resuspended in an appropriate volume of 50% Hybrisol (50% formamide, 2\\u00d7 SSC, 10% dextran sulfate). Slides and probes were denatured according to standard protocols. Hybridizations were done for at least 16 h at 37\\u00b0C in a darkened humid chamber. Slides were washed in 2\\u00d7 SSC at 70\\u00b0C for 10 min, rinsed 2\\u00d7 SSC at room temperature, and counterstained with 4\\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole II (Abbott Molecular/Vysis). Slides were imaged using an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope, and individual images were captured using an Applied Imaging system running CytoVision Genus version 3.9.  Probes-BAC clones RP11-314P15 (chromosome 14q12) and RP11-606C5 (spanning FOXA1 at 14q21.1) were labeled with SpectrumGreen and SpectrumRed dUTP, respectively (Abbott Molecular/Vysis). Both BAC clones were obtained from the BAC-PAC Resource at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute.  Scoring. For each specimen, at least 50 tumor nuclei were scored for the number of signals corresponding to the FOXA1 (T, test probe) and control probe (C), respectively, and T:C ratios were determined. Nuclei with a T:C ratio of 1:1 but with >2 signals per locus were scored as polysomic. Nuclei with a T:C ratio of >1 but with <3 signals per locus were scored as having FOXA1 copy number gain. Nuclei with a T:C ratio >3 were scored as amplified for FOXA1.  Statistical analysis  Results were compared by Student's t test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). FOXA1 and p27kip1 protein expression levels were compared by Pearson correlation coefficient. Statistical analysis was carried out with Microsoft Excel software.  Results  FOXA1 overexpression in ATC. To investigate whether FOXA1 is involved in thyroid tumorigenesis, we first examined FOXA1 mRNA and protein expression levels in human thyroid cancer cell lines. Several of the commonly used human thyroid cell lines have been recently shown to be not only redundant (cross-contaminated) but also of nonthyroid origin likely arising from melanoma and primary human colon carcinoma (23). For this reason, we performed our experiments on those cells with confirmed authenticity (23).  We examined the expression of FOXA1 by Western blot (Fig. 1A ) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B-D) in 8505c cells, an undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line, WRO82-1 cells, a follicular carcinoma cell line, and BCPAP and TPC-1 cells, papillary carcinoma cell lines. Whereas WRO82-1, BCPAP, and TPC-1 were negative for FOXA1 expression (data not shown), 8505c cells expressed high levels of FOXA1, which was exclusive nuclear.  Fig. 1.

H, 8505c cells were infected at the confluence of 60% for 3 to 6 h with two specific shRNAs anti-FOXA1 (sh#1 and sh#2) or shRNA anti-GFP sequence (sh-control). Nuclear FOXA1 protein levels were completely depleted with sh#1 and decreased by \\u223c30% with sh#2. Mean \\u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments. We confirmed the specificity of the anti-FOXA1 antibody by infecting 8505c cells with two lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs specific for FOXA1 (sh#1 and sh#2) or the control anti-GFP shRNA. FOXA1 mRNA levels were decreased \\u223c30% by sh#2 and by >90% by sh#1 (Fig. 1G). This degree of silencing of the FOXA1 mRNA was reflected by a similar level of silencing of the protein (Fig. 1H), confirming both the specificity of the anti-FOXA1 antibody and the effectiveness of the shRNAs.  We next asked whether FOXA1 expression could be detected in primary ATC. Differentiated thyroid carcinomas and insular thyroid tumors were negative for FOXA1 as were normal thyroid tissue and benign lesions. Human ATC, which are characterized by marked cellular polymorphism (giant, spindle, and squamoid cells), eccentric nuclei, and conspicuous nucleoli, showed nuclear overexpression of FOXA1 protein (nuclear staining score 3 or 4; Table 1 ). FOXA1 was expressed diffusely within the tumors with moderate to strong intensity (overexpression) in 14 of 20 (70%) ATC cases (Fig. 2 ), whereas 4 of 20 (20%) showed focal and low expression and 2 of 20 (10%) were negative. Strong nuclear expression was mainly observed in ATC with squamoid or squamous growth pattern characterized by markedly atypical nuclei and high proliferative activity as shown by the presence of numerous atypical mitoses (Fig. 2) and high MIB-1 proliferative index (>85%; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, we found moderate to strong nuclear expression of FOXA1 in foci of squamous metaplasia of 2 cases of papillary thyroid cancer.  View inlineView popup Table 1.

Intense FOXA1 nuclear staining is detected by immunohistochemical analysis (B and E). Finally, 7 ATC arising in association with small foci of differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma showed FOXA1 expression only in the undifferentiated areas (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Differentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas areas showed a very weak nuclear and cytoplasmic expression barely above the threshold of detection and not comparable with the expression levels seen in ATC. These weakly expressing cases were considered negative for FOXA1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C).  Genomic gain of FOXA1 in human primary ATC specimens. To determine whether FOXA1 expression in ATC was linked to FOXA1 copy number gain, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. FISH results were obtained for 14 of 20 ATC specimens because suboptimal tissue fixation precluded successful FISH analysis of six specimens. Hybridization of BAC RP11-606C5 to the TE4 cell line (human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line with amplification of FOXA1) was used as positive control and confirmed a pattern of amplification consistent with a homogeneously staining region. A range of three to seven copies of FOXA1 was detected in 10 of 14 (71.4%) ATC specimens (Fig. 2) and occurred as a result of polysomy (hybridization pattern consistent with multiple copies of chromosome 14). Disomy for FOXA1 was observed for 2 of 14 (14%) ATC specimens, with a signal pattern consistent with monosomy 14 detected in the remaining 2 of 14 ATC specimens. In addition, 8 of 11 (72.7%) ATC tumors with nuclear FOXA1 protein overexpression showed copy number gain (Fig. 2), 2 of 11 (18.1%) specimens with overexpression were disomic for FOXA1, and 1 of 11 (9%) was consistent with monosomy 14 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Two of 11 (18.1%) ATC with overexpressed FOXA1 showed one to two additional copies in a subset (\\u223c22%) of tumor nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Finally, 8505c cells showed copy number gain of FOXA1 due to polysomy (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In summary, we show that FOXA1 is overexpressed and subject to copy number gain in human ATC.  Down-regulation of FOXA1 suppresses cell proliferation in human ATC cells correlated with transcriptional up-regulation of p27kip1. We investigated the functional role of FOXA1 in ATC cells by examining the effect of FOXA1 silencing on cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. Indeed, it has been previously shown that poorly or undifferentiated human thyroid cancer cells exhibit considerable imbalance of their cell cycle and multiple abnormal cell signal transduction pathways that determine rapid cellular proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and genomic instability (24).  To answer the question whether FOXA1 may affect cell proliferation, we conducted a cell cycle analysis in 8505c cells after FOXA1 silencing by two independent shRNAs. Cell growth curves after 1 week of FOXA1 showed a strong decrease of 8505c cellular proliferation by sh#1 (P < 0.01) and a slight decrease by sh#2 (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A ), which were consistent with the levels of FOXA1 silencing (Fig. 1G-H). Similarly, BrdUrd incorporation (% of cell uptake) decreased in shRNA-treated cells compared with the control (sh#1 P < 0.01 and sh#2 P < 0.05; Fig. 3B and C).

Effects of FOXA1 silencing on cell cycle of human thyroid carcinoma cells. 8505c cells were infected at the confluence of 60% for 3 to 6 h with two shRNAs against FOXA1 (sh#1 and sh#2) or shRNA anti-GFP sequence (sh-control). A, 8505c cells infected with either sh#1 or sh#2 showed a significant decrease in cellular proliferation after 1 week (**, P < 0.01 and *, P < 0.05, respectively) versus control. B and C, similarly, BrdUrd incorporation (% of cell uptake) was dramatically decreased in 8505c cells infected with sh#1 FOXA1 (7.4 \\u00b1 0.8%; **, P < 0.001), whereas a moderate decrease was detectable with sh#2 FOXA1 (42.2 \\u00b1 2.8%; *, P < 0.05) versus control (49.2 \\u00b1 2.7%). D and E, cell cycle redistribution on treatment by FOXA1 shRNAs. S-phase decrease was consistent with BrdUrd incorporation in 8505c cells infected with sh#1 (10.3 \\u00b1 3.0%; ***, P < 0.001) and sh#2 (34.7 \\u00b1 0.7%; *, P < 0.05) versus control (40.7 \\u00b1 2.9%). A growth arrest in G1 phase but no apoptosis (sub-G1 cell population) occurred on both sh#1 anti-FOXA1 (58.8 \\u00b1 1.2%; ***, P < 0.001) and sh#2 (38.4 \\u00b1 0.7%; *, P < 0.05) versus control (35.4 \\u00b1 1.2%). Percentage of cells in G2-M phase resulted also increased by sh#1 (29.9 \\u00b1 2.2%; *, P < 0.05). F, protein levels of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 significantly increased in 8505c cells with both sh#1 (74.4%) and sh#2 (19.87%). G, p27kip1 relative mRNA expression levels were also significantly rescued in sh#1 (average of the relative mRNA levels, 4.87 \\u00b1 0.04; ***, P < 0.001) and sh#2-infected 8505c cells (average of the relative mRNA levels, 2.1 \\u00b1 0.3; **, P < 0.01) versus control. Mean \\u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments. We further investigated the cell cycle distribution of 8505c cells by flow cytometry analysis in which FOXA1 had been silenced and observed a reduction of the fraction of cells in S phase (Fig. 3D and E), concomitant with an increase in the number of cells in both G1 (P < 0.001) and G2-M (P < 0.05) phases. The G1-S transition of the cell cycle is controlled by different cyclins. Hence, we monitored the effect of FOXA1 silencing on several of these molecular factors: p21waf1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1. None of these cyclins was differentially expressed between sh-FOXA1 and sh-control in 8505c cells at either mRNA or protein level (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).  However, we found that p27kip1, a crucial cell cycle inhibitor, was significantly increased in 8505c cells infected with either FOXA1 sh#1 or sh#2 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3F and G).  Finally, FOXA1 silencing did not induce apoptosis in the infected cells as confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (absence of sub-G1 cell population; Fig. 3D and E) and absence of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. S3B).  Inverse correlation between p27kip1 and FOXA1 expression in human ATC specimens. p27kip1 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 20 human ATC cases. Two cases were excluded due to technical issues. The remaining 18 cases were divided into four categories with respect to p27kip1 and FOXA1 expression and an inverse correlation between these protein levels was observed (r = -0.547; Fig. 4 ). Eleven (61%) of the cases had high nuclear FOXA1 expression (3 or 4+) and absent p27kip1 expression (1+; Fig. 4). Two (11%) of the cases had absent FOXA1 expression (1+) and moderate to high p27kip1 expression (2 or 3+; Fig. 4). Four (22%) of the cases had low FOXA1 expression (2+) and absent p27kip1 expression (1+; Fig. 4). One (6%) case had absent FOXA1 and p27kip1 expression (1+ for both; Fig. 4). In addition, 6 of 18 (33.3%) ATC showed a residual small focus of differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma and weak p27kip1cytoplasmic expression was observed in all differentiated tumor foci associated with ATC (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Discussion  In this study, we found that human ATC express FOXA1 protein and show an intriguing link between FOXA1 expression, undifferentiated status, and cellular proliferation. Normal thyroid tissues, benign lesions, and differentiated thyroid carcinomas did not show detectable expression of FOXA1. Interestingly, we detected moderate nuclear protein levels of FOXA1 in squamous metaplasia foci of papillary well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, a rare pathologic transformation that occurs in follicular thyroid tissues, still not well understood in terms of potential transition to undifferentiated thyroid cancer. This may suggest a role of FOXA1 in thyroid cell differentiation, because this transcription factor is already known to be expressed at 15.5 days in endoderm-derived mouse tissues including thyroid (25).  We found that FOXA1 nuclear overexpression was related to chromosome 14 gain in 72.7% of ATC. About 20% of the ATC that overexpressed FOXA1 showed low-level gain of FOXA1 (1-2 additional copies), consistent with unbalanced rearrangements involving this locus. Our results are supported by previous studies showing copy number gain of other chromosomes in ATC (26\\u201328) due to ploidy changes or unbalanced rearrangements that significantly occur in aggressive papillary thyroid carcinomas (29) and poorly differentiated thyroid cancers (30) and are less frequent in well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas (26). This evidence suggests that copy number gains are genetic events of the progression from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated thyroid cancers to ATC, as they are also associated with an aggressive clinicopathologic behavior.  FOXA1 has been shown to be amplified and overexpressed in 6% to 9% of human esophageal and 40% lung adenocarcinomas (31, 32). A copy number gain due to polysomy of the FOXA1 locus in ATC has not been reported. In our study, we found that 71.4% of ATC harbor this genomic alteration, supporting the idea that the genetic complexity of these tumors may play a role in producing the aggressive phenotype. We suggest that 14q gains are selected for because of FOXA1 overexpression, although we cannot rule out the possibility that this is simply the result of genomic instability. Conversely, we found a low percentage of disomic ATC in the FOXA1 locus, suggesting that other potential genetic alterations could occur. There was one ATC specimen (<10%) that showed FOXA1 overexpression and monosomy of chromosome 14.  We showed that shRNA-mediated silencing of FOXA1 significantly suppresses proliferation by blocking the G1-S transition of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. These data suggest that FOXA1 might be one of the genes necessary and involved in the complex machinery of cellular proliferation of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and could represent a potential new target for treatment of undifferentiated thyroid cancers. We propose that inhibition of cell proliferation due to FOXA1 silencing in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cells resulted in the reexpression of p27kip1 mRNA and protein levels, which are usually very low or absent in this type of cancer. This is supported with the detection of an inverse correlation between loss of nuclear p27kip1 protein and high levels of FOXA1 protein in human ATC cells. Our results suggest that FOXA1 in ATC cells could be a novel and important gene affecting cell proliferation by a potential transcriptional inhibition of p27kip1. A FOXA1 binding site within the BRCA1-responsive element of the p27kip1 promoter has been identified (33). p27kip1 has been widely known to be a critical inhibitor of cell cycle progression in human cancer cells (34), including thyroid cancer cells (35).  Cytoplasmic sequestration of p27kip1 generally is associated with well-differentiated tumors, whereas loss of nuclear expression occurs in the aggressive tumoral phenotypes (36). p27kip1 expression is controversial in ATC; in fact, some authors have described low protein levels (35, 36), whereas others have reported a similar quantity and intensity in ATC and differentiated thyroid carcinomas (37). Loss of nuclear p27kip1 represents an independent predictor of metastatic disease in thyroid cancer (38) and in other human aggressive cancers associated with poor prognosis (39). Forkhead transcription factors such as FKHRL1 and FKHR are critical effectors of cell death and cell cycle arrest downstream of PTEN by p27kip1 induction (40). Conversely, FOXA1 may deregulate the inhibitor p27kip1 in ATC cells and increase cell proliferation. Although different mechanisms are involved, FOXA1 is required for cellular proliferation in both undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cells and breast cancer cells (16, 41\\u201343). Indeed, FOXA1 silencing did not trigger a decrease in cyclin D1 levels in ATC as previously found in breast cancer (16). On the other hand, FOXA1 may stimulate ATC cell cycle progression through inhibition of p27kip1 expression. This could be linked to direct and/or indirect cell type-specific activities of FOXA1 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Note that FOXA1 overexpression was able to induce p27kip1 expression in breast cancer cell models (44), suggesting that mechanisms involved in cell growth regulation might depend on the amount of FOXA1 protein in different cell types.  Importantly, it has been recently shown that FOXA1 regulates distinct transcriptional programs in cells of different lineages and translates epigenetic signatures into changes in chromatin structure, thereby establishing lineage-specific transcriptional enhancers and programs (45).  In summary, we show that (a) FOXA1 is expressed in human ATC, (b) increased FOXA1 expression is related to FOXA1 gains and polysomy 14 in ATC, (c) FOXA1 down-regulation by shRNA in ATC cells suppresses cell proliferation, and (d) FOXA1 may be actively involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation in ATC cells by regulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1. Overall, our data reveal a novel potential role for FOXA1 as an oncogenic transcription factor in thyroid cancer. Therefore, identifying transcription factor networks involving FOXA1 in ATC may offer new alternative treatments based on molecular targets. Characterization of the prostate cancer transcriptome and genome has identified chromosomal rearrangements and copy number gains/losses, including ETS gene fusions, PTEN loss and androgen receptor (AR) amplification, that drive prostate cancer development and progression to lethal, metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)1. As less is known about the role of mutations2\\u20134, here we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal, heavily-pretreated metastatic CRPCs obtained at rapid autopsy (including three different foci from the same patient) and 11 treatment na\\u00efve, high-grade localized prostate cancers. We identified low overall mutation rates even in heavily treated CRPC (2.00/Mb) and confirmed the monoclonal origin of lethal CRPC. Integrating exome copy number analysis identified disruptions of CHD1, which define a subtype of ETS fusionnegative prostate cancer. Similarly, we demonstrate that ETS2, which is deleted in ~1/3 of CRPCs (commonly through TMPRSS2:ERG fusions), is also deregulated through mutation. Further, we identified recurrent mutations in multiple chromatin/histone modifying genes, including MLL2 (mutated in 8.6% of prostate cancers), and demonstrate interaction of the MLL complex with AR, which is required for AR-mediated signaling. We also identified novel recurrent mutations in the AR collaborating factor FOXA1, which is mutated in 5 of 147 (3.4%) prostate cancers (both untreated localized prostate cancer and CRPC), and showed that mutated FOXA1 represses androgen signaling and increases tumour growth. Proteins that physically interact with AR, such as the ERG gene fusion product, FOXA1, MLL2, UTX, and ASXL1 were found to be mutated in CRPC. In summary, we describe the mutational landscape of a heavily treated metastatic cancer, identify novel mechanisms of AR signaling deregulated in prostate cancer, and prioritize candidates for future study.  Although localized prostate cancer is highly curable, more than 32,000 U.S. men die annually of metastatic disease. Androgen-deprivation therapy results in rapid responses in men with metastatic prostate cancer, however nearly all patients eventually progress (castrate resistant prostate cancer [CRPC]). Although CRPC was thought to be androgen signaling independent, recent evidence demonstrates that androgen signaling is often maintained through varied mechanisms (reviewed in1,5). Gene expression and copy number profiling studies have identified recurrent gene fusions, chromosomal gains and losses, and deregulated pathways in prostate cancer 1. Resequencing studies have characterized the mutational spectrum of prostate cancer3,4,6, and the genomes of seven localized prostate cancers have been reported by Berger et al. 7. More recently, Kumar et al. reported the exomes of xenografts from 16 CRPC cases2.  Here, we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal heavily pretreated CRPCs (WA2-60) obtained at rapid autopsy8, including three distinct sites in the same patient, and eleven treatment na\\u00efve, high-grade localized prostate cancers (T1-T97) (Supplementary Table 1). Sequencing results, including coverage statistics, mutation rates, validation rates, mutational spectrum, confirmation of the monoclonal origin of CRPC, and overlap with mutations observed in previous studies are provided in the Supplementary Results, Supplementary Figures 1\\u20136 & Tables 2\\u20136.  We used exome sequencing data to identify somatic copy number alterations 9 (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Tables 7\\u20139), and as shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 we identified recurrent aberrations previously associated with prostate cancer development and progression (Supplementary Results). We additionally performed array CGH (aCGH) copy number and gene expression profiling on a matched cohort of benign prostate tissues, localized prostate cancers (3/59 sequenced) and 35 CRPCs (31/35 sequenced) (Supplementary Table 10). Profiles were uploaded into Oncomine (www.oncomine.com) for automated data processing, analysis and visualization, and are available for exploration. aCGH profiles were similar to copy number analysis by exome sequencing and to other prostate cancer profiling studies available in Oncomine (Supplementary Fig. 9). Global gene expression profiles were similar to previous studies (analyses available in Oncomine), with exceptions described in the Supplementary Results and Supplementary Fig. 10. Finally, we performed transcriptome sequencing of 11 prostate cancer cell lines to identify likely somatic variants (see Supplementary Results, Methods and Tables 11\\u201315).  From our exome data, we identified nine genes that were significantly mutated (false discovery rate \\u2264 0.10) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 16&4), six of which have been reported as recurrently mutated in prostate cancer: TP53, AR, ZFHX3, RB1, PTEN and APC. Three significantly mutated genes do not have described roles in prostate cancer: MLL2, OR5L1 and CDK12. MLL2 encodes a H3K4-specific histone methyltransferase that is recurrently mutated in multiple cancers and CDK12 was recently identified as significantly mutated in ovarian serous carcinoma10. Additionally, using several approaches, we identified multiple significantly mutated pathways, including WNT signaling, and a PTEN interaction network (Supplementary Figure 11 & Tables 17&18); observations on significantly mutated genes and pathways are provided in the Supplementary Results.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Integrated mutational landscape of lethal metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) Multiple candidate driver mutations in genes associated with AR signaling, DNA damage response, histone/chromatin modification, the spindle checkpoint, and classical tumour suppressors and oncogenes were also identified (Fig. 1). For example, we identified two deleterious mutations in PRKDC (I1137fs and E640*), which encodes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase involved in DNA double strand break repair and recombination, in patient T96, who had an extremely aggressive localized prostate cancer. Additional mutated genes in these pathways are described in the Supplementary Results.  To identify potential CRPC drivers, we considered genes with recurrent high-level gains or losses present in peaks of global copy number change, and compared results to mutated genes (Supplementary Fig. 12), as described in the Supplementary Results. Thus, we were intrigued by the peak of copy number loss on chr 5q21 (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig. 12) harboring CHD1, which encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme reported as deregulated in 3 of 7 prostate cancer genomes by Berger et al. (one somatic splice-site mutation and two rearrangements)7. As described in the Supplementary Results & Figure 13, across our exome and aCGH copy number analysis, we identified focal deletion/mutation of CHD1 (CHD1\\u2212) in 10/119 (8%) prostate cancers, which was significantly associated with ETS gene fusion negative (ETS\\u2212)status (two sided Fisher\\u2019s exact test, p=0.02). Association of CHD1 gene expression and genomic CHD1\\u2212 status is shown in Supplementary Fig. 13b.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Integrated exome sequencing and copy number analysis highlights novel aspects of ETS genes in prostate cancer biology: deregulation of CHD1 and ETS2 We next analyzed the association between CHD1\\u2212 and ETS status in three prostate cancer aCGH and nine expression profiling studies (totaling 835 additional cancers) using Oncomine (Supplementary Results). As shown in Supplementary Figure 14 and Table 19 and Figure 2b, in total, across 13 DNA and RNA based studies, we identified 50 of 954 (5.2%) prostate cancers as CHD1\\u2212, 48 of which (96%) were ETS\\u2212 (p<0.0001, two sided Fisher\\u2019s exact test). Together, our integrated analysis identifies CHD1\\u2212/ ETS\\u2212 as a novel prostate cancer subtype.  ETS genes have a central role in prostate cancer, most commonly through fusion to androgen driven genes (i.e. TMPRSS2:ERG), and as the majority of ETS gene fusion positive (ETS+) CRPCs retained marked over-expression of the rearranged ETS gene (ERG, ETV1 or ETV5), our results support active androgen signaling in the majority of these men (Supplementary Fig. 13b). We next further explored the role of ETS genes in prostate cancer by evaluating our dataset for aberrations in additional ETS genes. Importantly, two CRPCs harbored deleterious mutations in ETV3, (P327fs in WA56 and W38* in WA26, both ETS+), which does not have a described role in prostate cancer. In addition, we were intrigued by the mutation of ETS2 (R437C) in WA30 (ETS\\u2212), as ETS2 shows a similar DNA binding motif as ERG11 and is located immediately telomeric to ERG (head-to-head orientation) in the commonly deleted region in TMPRSS2:ERG fusions through deletion. We also identified focal deletions extending telomeric from ERG in ERG+ cancers, as well as focal deletion of ETS2 in WA31, which shows outlier under-expression of ETS2 (Supplementary Results, & Fig 15). Additionally, the R437C mutation in ETS2 occurs in the ETS domain at a DNA contacting residue conserved in class I ETS transcription factors11, which include all ETS genes known to be involved in gene fusions in prostate cancer (Fig. 2c). Given observations that prostate cancers with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions through deletion may be more aggressive than those with fusions through insertion, we and others have speculated that the intervening region may harbor tumour suppressors, including ETS212\\u201314. As shown in Fig 2d, we demonstrate that over-expression of wild type ETS2 results in decreased migration, invasion and proliferation in VCaP cells, while the R437C mutation has opposite effects, supporting a potential tumour suppressive role for ETS2.  In addition to MLL2 and CHD1, our integrated analysis identified mutations and copy number aberrations in multiple other genes involved in chromatin/histone modification (Fig. 1), including multiple members of the MLL complex (see Supplementary Results and Fig 3). Besides CHD1, which shows deregulation in both localized prostate cancer and CRPC (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 13&14), mutations of other chromatin/histone remodeling genes were infrequent in localized prostate cancer and concentrated in a single sample (T97, Fig. 1). Hence, we hypothesized that the mutated chromatin/histone remodelers we identified may mediate AR signaling through interaction. Thus, we immunoprecipitated endogenous AR from VCaP cells (ERG+ CRPC, active AR signaling) and blotted for members of the MLL complex (MLL2, MLL, ASH2L), UTX, ASXL1 and CHD1. FOXA1, a known direct interacting AR cofactor15, and EZH2 (a H3K27 histone methyltransferase over-expressed in CRPC), were evaluated as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Figure 3a, members of the MLL complex, UTX and ASXL1 all interact with AR, while interaction with CHD1 was not observed. Reverse immunoprecipitation confirmed interactions between AR and MLL, MLL2, ASH2L and FOXA1 (Supplementary Fig. S16a).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) harbors mutational aberrations in chromatin/histone modifiers that physically interact with AR As the MLL complex is implicated in epigenetic transcriptional activation, we studied its role in AR signaling. RNA interference of MLL or ASH2L using independent siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 16b) significantly inhibited AR signaling, as assessed by inhibition of R1881 (synthetic androgen) stimulation of KLK3 (PSA) expression, with two siRNAs each against MLL or ASH2L inhibiting KLK3 expression at 24 hours by > 7.5 fold (each p<0.001) (Fig. 3b). Together, our data suggest that aberrations in AR and interacting proteins, including chromatin/histone remodelers, ETS genes (exemplified by ERG, which directly interacts with AR16) and known AR co-regulators including FOXA1 (see below), are common in CRPC (Fig. 3c).  Given the central role of AR signaling in CRPC and the selection for aberrations in AR occurring in CRPC, we were intrigued by the identification of a somatic 2 bp insertion in FOXA1 (S453fs) in the localized prostate cancer sample T12, and 340fs and P358fs indels in DU-145 and LAPC-4 (identified by transcriptome sequencing), respectively, given the well described role of FOXA1 in AR signaling17\\u201322. Thus, we screened 101 localized and 46 CRPCs (including foci from all exome sequenced CRPCs), and identified somatic mutations of FOXA1 in 4 localized prostate cancers and 1 CRPC (total 5 of 147, 3.4%). Importantly, 4 of the 5 mutations, as well as both indels identified in the transcriptome screen, occurred in the C-terminal transactivating domain (Fig. 4a). As described in the Supplementary Results, we demonstrate that stable expression in LNCaP cells of either wild type FOXA1 or observed FOXA1 mutants increase proliferation in the presence of androgen (Fig 4b&c), represses the AR transcriptional program (Fig. 4d), and result in increased soft agar colony (Supplementary Fig 17) and xenograft growth (Fig 4e).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Recurrent mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) collaborating factor FOXA1 promote tumour growth and affect AR signaling Our integrated, exome-based profiling of the mutational landscape of CRPC is notable for representing a large cohort of heavily pre-treated patients with lethal metastatic disease, which are not commonly studied, and provides insights into the resistance mechanisms that evolve in refractory tumours. Additionally, we identified a diverse series of potentially driving mutations and copy number alterations in both known and novel genes and pathways, including FOXA1. Lastly, our integrative genomics dataset provides a useful resource for the study of lethal prostate cancer, as well as determinants of, or resistance mechanisms to, radiation and chemotherapy.  Advanced prostate cancer can progress to systemic metastatic tumors, which are generally androgen insensitive and ultimately lethal. Here, we report a comprehensive genomic survey for somatic events in systemic metastatic prostate tumors using both high-resolution copy number analysis and targeted mutational survey of 3508 exons from 577 cancer-related genes using next generation sequencing. Focal homozygous deletions were detected at 8p22, 10q23.31, 13q13.1, 13q14.11, and 13q14.12. Key genes mapping within these deleted regions include PTEN, BRCA2, C13ORF15, and SIAH3. Focal high-level amplifications were detected at 5p13.2-p12, 14q21.1, 7q22.1, and Xq12. Key amplified genes mapping within these regions include SKP2, FOXA1, and AR. Furthermore, targeted mutational analysis of normal-tumor pairs has identified somatic mutations in genes known to be associated with prostate cancer including AR and TP53, but has also revealed novel somatic point mutations in genes including MTOR, BRCA2, ARHGEF12, and CHD5. Finally, in one patient where multiple independent metastatic tumors were available, we show common and divergent somatic alterations that occur at both the copy number and point mutation level, supporting a model for a common clonal progenitor with metastatic tumor-specific divergence. Our study represents a deep genomic analysis of advanced metastatic prostate tumors and has revealed candidate somatic alterations, possibly contributing to lethal prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer still remains the most common male-specific malignancy diagnosed in the United States. In 2009 there were an estimated 192,280 newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer with 27,360 deaths attributed to this disease (Jemal et al. 2009). Although we have seen slight decreases in incidence rates, primarily due to new methods in estimating new cancer cases by the American Cancer Society, death rates have remained fairly constant between 2007 (27,050) and 2009 (27,360) (Jemal et al. 2007, 2008, 2009). In most cases, these deaths are associated with androgen-insensitive systemic metastatic prostate disease. In light of this incredible clinical problem, there is a growing need to understand the molecular makeup of these lethal tumors. In order to uncover the genomic characteristics of systemic lethal metastatic prostate tumors, we have used high-resolution oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and targeted resequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies in a set of eight tumors from six patients who died of widespread systemic metastatic disease to expose somatic events occurring in lethal cancer.  During the past year, three studies have been reported using genomic profiling to identify somatic copy number alterations specifically in clinical metastatic prostate tumors. In one study, a set of approximately 50 castration-resistant metastatic prostate tumors from 14 patients were analyzed using array aCGH, gene expression profiling, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Holcomb et al. 2009). The results of that study replicated the high frequency of certain alterations such as 8p loss and 8q gain, and frequency of chromosome 21 TMPRSS2-ERG fusion deletions in prostate tumors (Holcomb et al. 2009). Their combined analysis of aCGH and gene expression implicated certain genes in metastatic prostate cancer (Holcomb et al. 2009). Finally, they associate specific alterations with metastasis to specific distant sites (Holcomb et al. 2009). CGH arrays for this study were based on 4200 BAC clones spaced at >400 kb, whose low resolution decreases the ability to discover focal deletions or amplifications. In a more recent study reported by Liu et al. (2009), high-resolution 1.8 million feature single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to assess copy number changes in a series of 94 metastatic tumors from 14 patients, where multiple lesions were studied from each patient (Liu et al. 2009). They showed that most, if not all, lesions from each patient shared at least one somatic event, suggesting that metastatic tumors from any given patient were derived from a common progenitor tumor cell (Liu et al. 2009). Furthermore, their data also suggested that there was no obvious relationship between specific lesions and specific systemic metastatic sites (Liu et al. 2009), contrary to results reported by Holcomb et al. (2009). In addition, although high-resolution SNP arrays were used, the only specific alterations reported were TMPRSS2-ERG fusion breakpoint events and AR locus copy number gains. More recently, a very comprehensive genomic study was published for 218 total primary and metastatic tumors, including copy number analysis, gene expression, miRNA analysis, and mutational analysis of exons from more than 100 genes using Sanger sequencing methods (Taylor et al. 2010). In this study, there were five metastatic tumors that were interrogated for both copy number analysis and mutational analysis. The overall results of this study support a significant role for somatic alterations in the gene NCOA2 in prostate cancer (Taylor et al. 2010). Furthermore, they reported an overall low number of somatic point mutations and point to copy number alterations as the most common abnormality affecting prostate tumors. Together these studies have shed significant light on gross copy number changes, have implicated specific regions in metastatic disease, and in a few cases have implicated specific genes that might be involved in metastatic prostate cancer.  A number of candidate genes have been reported that harbor somatic mutations in localized prostate cancer, including AR, TP53, KLF6, EPHB2, CHEK2, ZFHX3 (formerly known as ATBF1), and NCOA2 (Newmark et al. 1992; Gottlieb et al. 2004; Huusko et al. 2004; Sun et al. 2005; Dong 2006; Zheng et al. 2006; Agell et al. 2008; Taylor et al. 2010). However, there are limited reports of somatic coding mutations in metastatic tumors. One such example is a study reported by Wong et al. (2007), which describes mutations in the gene encoding plexin-B in metastatic prostate cancer (Wong et al. 2007); however, as of yet these results have not been replicated in the literature.  Here, we have applied high-resolution aCGH and targeted mutational analysis of a set of known cancer-related genes using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to uncover somatic alterations occurring in the genomes of systemic lethal metastatic prostate tumors. We have replicated copy number alterations known to occur in prostate tumors, including metastatic lesions, and we have also discovered novel focal high-level amplifications and homozygous deletions implicating new genes in metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, we have searched extensively for somatic coding mutations in prostate tumors using targeted NGS. Our study has uncovered mutations in known tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes and has also revealed new candidate genes harboring somatic mutations in lethal metastatic disease.  Go to: Results and Discussion Our overall sample set is described in Table 1 and consists of eight systemic lethal metastatic tumors and corresponding normal tissue from six unrelated patients with confirmed primary diagnosis of prostate cancer. As tumor cellularity within tissue samples can confound genomic analyses, we quality-controlled our frozen specimens to determine percent tumor content (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Description of sample set To search for somatic copy number events in our sample set, we used an array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) platform built upon roughly 1 million unique genomic oligonucleotide probes, which provides an average probe density of \\u223c3 kb across the genome. Log2 ratios calculated between differentially labeled tumor and reference DNA were plotted for analysis and visualization using Agilent DNA Analytics software. All samples used in the analysis passed quality control as measured by DNA Analytics software (data not shown). Our analyses relied on the ADM-2 algorithm in DNA Analytics software for improved calling of copy number alterations (Lipson et al. 2006). These high-quality and high-resolution data allowed us to focus our copy number analyses on focal somatic copy number events. Focal deletions are defined here as regions of <5 million base pairs (Mb) with average log2 ratios for neighboring probes of less than \\u22122, suggesting homozygous deletion. Focal amplifications are defined here as regions of <5 Mb with average log2 ratios for neighboring probes of +2 or greater. A list of these regions and detailed descriptions are provided in Table 2.  Table 2. Table 2. Regions of focal copy number change in metastatic prostate tumors To discover somatic coding mutations in systemic metastatic prostate tumors, we used Raindance Technologies massive single-plex droplet-based PCR method to amplify a panel of 4002 primer pairs that target 3508 annotated exon sequences from 577 candidate genes in each of our samples. These PCR amplicons were then sequenced using the Applied Biosystems (Life Technologies) SOLiD System NGS technology. The gene set was selected from a panel of genes previously implicated in cancer (Sjoblom et al. 2006) and contains exons from several genes reported to be mutated in prostate cancer, including AR, TP53, EPHB2, CHEK2, NCOA2, and PLXB1. The total amplicon bases (exons and splice junctions) represented 1.63 Mb, of which 1.34 Mb represent exon sequences. An analysis pipeline was used that included the BFAST alignment tool (Homer et al. 2009) and variant detection using the tools SolSNP version 1.0 (SA Sinari, A Christoforides, J Beckstrom-Sternberg, A Kurdoglu, JD Carpten, DW Craig, S Beckstrom-Sternberg, JV Pearson, in prep.) and GATK (McKenna et al. 2010) to search for base substitutions and small insertions/deletions (indels). Detailed descriptions of this analysis pipeline are provided in the Supplemental Methods. Quality metrics on alignment are provided in Supplemental Table 2. Known SNPs were annotated so that they could be removed from the analysis (data not shown). Annotation was performed on coding variants to identify those that change an amino acid. A final filter was performed to discover those coding variants that were only present in tumor, or were previously shown to be oncogenic. A total of 14 coding mutations were detected, including 12 missense mutations and two nonsense mutations (Table 3). Importantly, all mutations were detected by both SolSNP and GATK. We also detected small (<5 bp) indels using GATK; however, after filtering, we did not discover any novel somatic coding indels within our sample set. Visual inspection and further analysis taking into account base quality confirmed that mutations were true positives. Furthermore, several mutations were empirically validated using alternative technologies (Supplemental Fig. 3). To help determine whether nonsynonymous missense mutations were functionally relevant, all mutations were analyzed using SIFT, an algorithm that predicts the likelihood that an amino acid substitution affects protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids (Ng and Henikoff 2001, 2003; Kumar et al. 2009). SIFT analysis results predict that 10 of 12 (83%) missense mutations detected in our study are damaging and are likely to confer significant consequences on the encoded proteins (Table 3). However, to understand the significance of these SIFT results, we performed an analysis to determine the rate of \\u201cdamaging\\u201d nonsynonymous changes from a random set of nonsynonymous changes. First, three sets of \\u223c10,000 random nonsynonymous variants were generated by selecting random lines containing nonsynonymous variants from a list of annotated variant calls from CEU and YRI populations from the 1000 Genomes pilot SNP Calls (030810 Release) (http://www.1000genomes.org). These variants were appropriately formatted for input and submission into SIFT. Upon processing of the result files for damaging variants, we calculated a ratio of the number of damaging variants to the total number submitted to SIFT. Across all datasets, roughly 15% of the nonsynonymous variants were predicted to be damaging by SIFT. This was in contrast to 10 (damaging) of 12 nonsynonymous mutations (83%) from our set of mutations detected in metastatic tumor specimens.  Table 3. Table 3. List of mutations discovered in metastatic prostate tumors All focal somatic copy number changes and key genes affected and mutated are presented in Figure 1. Analysis of our copy number and mutation data further supports a major role for androgen pathway alterations in prostate cancer, including systemic metastatic lesions. Of the six patients studied, we have direct evidence of somatic alterations involving the AR gene in three patients, including high-level focal amplification of the AR locus in tumors RA49LT and RA50AT (Table 2; Fig. 1). Although the specific boundaries of these regions are independent in these two tumors, the region was \\u223c1.4 Mb in both tumors and only contained EDA2R and AR. Furthermore, analysis of mutation data revealed the presence of the known AR H874Y oncogenic mutation in tumor RA48RM (Table 3; Fig. 1). Moreover, tumors from two of the patients with activating events of AR (RA48RM and RA50AT) also contain TMPRSS2-ERG fusion breakpoint events at 21q (Table 2). Interestingly, although R49LT contains high-level amplification at the AR locus, no detectable fusion breakpoint events were detected in this tumor at the genomic level. However, we cannot rule out the presence of fusion transcripts, as they can occur by mechanisms that are not easily detectable at the DNA level (Maher et al. 2009). Furthermore, we detected a clonal focal (\\u223c1.6 Mb) amplicon at 14q21.1 in three independent metastatic lesions from a single patient (RA45), which encompasses only six known genes (MIPOL1, FOXA1, TTC6, SSTR1, CLEC14A, SEC23A) (Table 2). Foxa transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 interact directly with the androgen receptor and are involved in transcriptional activity of androgen-regulated genes (Gao et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2005). Furthermore, increased expression of FOXA1 and FOXA2 has been linked to prostate tumorigenesis and progression (Yu et al. 2005; Mirosevich et al. 2006; van der Heul-Nieuwenhuijsen et al. 2009). Therefore, based on the known functional role of FOXA1 in prostate tumorigenesis, our data would suggest that this gene is a candidate oncogene mapping within the 14q focal amplicon in tumors from patient RA45. These results provide further evidence for the importance of AR signaling in prostate cancer, which is still of vital importance for the treatment of advanced prostate disease.  Figure 1. Figure 1. Circos plot illustrating copy number alterations and genes affected by somatic mutation. Regions affected by focal copy number events are plotted within the gray inner circle with deleted regions deviating below copy neutrality (toward center) and amplified ... We have also discovered a number of other events that contain genes previously associated with important cancer pathways and processes. Several tumors contained alterations affecting the PI3K/AKT pathway. One homozygous deletion in tumor RA49LT encompasses 1.176 Mb at 10q23 and contains 12 genes, among which is the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene. Furthermore, we have identified a MTOR 6809G>T (R2270L) point mutation in all three metastatic lesions analyzed from patient RA45 (Table 3). MTOR encodes the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), which is a known oncogene and major target of therapeutic drug development for a number of tumor types including androgen-insensitive prostate cancer. A search of the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in the Cancer (COSMIC) database revealed that MTOR mutations have been seen in other tumor types. The R2270L MTOR mutation discovered in our analysis maps within the catalytic site of the MTOR kinase domain, and this amino acid is highly conserved throughout evolution. Moreover, the mutation is predicted as damaging by SIFT analysis. Importantly, this mutation could have significant clinical implications. MTOR inhibitors are under considerable development in phase II clinical trials for treating metastatic prostate cancer, and the presence of the mutation could have positive or negative implications, where the direct activation of MTOR by mutation could render patients either sensitive or resistant to these agents.  Tumors RA45M, RA45RM, and RA45AT, which were derived from the same patient, all exhibit high-level gain at 5p13.2-p12, characterized by a focal (850 kb) high-level amplicon on the background of a larger region (8.5 Mb) of 5p gain (Fig. 2). The smaller 850-kb region of high-level amplification encompasses only 10 genes, including the SKP2 oncogene. SKP2 is a member of the F-box protein family and interacts with S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 SKP1 to promote ubiquitination and degradation of proteins, most notably the tumor-suppressor CDKN1B, p27 (Bai et al. 1996; Shibahara 2005). SKP2 has been characterized as an oncogene in a number of tumor types and its overexpression is associated with tumor aggressiveness (Hershko 2008). Specifically, SKP2 overexpression and corresponding down-regulation of p27 has been previously linked to a poor outcome in prostate cancer (Yang et al. 2002; Zheng et al. 2004). Furthermore, a recent link has been established between androgen signaling and SKP2 promoting proliferation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (Wang et al. 2008). In a recent report, 5p gains encompassing SKP2 occur at a significant frequency in prostate cancer (Taylor et al. 2010). Therefore, these data taken together would suggest that copy number gain or high-level amplification of the SKP2 locus, as discovered in our study, is a potential mechanism for up-regulation of SKP2, and would point to SKP2 as a driver of tumorigenesis in tumors from patient RA45.  Figure 2. Figure 2. Illustration of high-level amplification at 5p13.2 in tumors from patient RA45. (A) Chromosome view in Agilent DNA Analytics software showing log2 ratios for probes mapping along chromosome 5 for RA45M (left), RA45RM (middle), and RA45AT (right). Amplicon ... We have also detected independent somatic alterations of the BRCA2 tumor-suppressor gene, implicating double-strand-break repair defects in metastatic prostate cancer (Fig. 1). One event is defined by a 2.63-Mb homozygous deletion at 13q12.3\\u2013q13.2 that encompasses the BRCA2 locus in tumor RA48RM (Table 2). Our analysis has also revealed a BRCA2 7840C>T (L2614F) somatic point mutation in tumor RA53T. This mutation is predicted as damaging by SIFT (Table 3). Of considerable interest is published evidence that up-regulation of SKP2 can result in BRCA2 degradation in prostate tumors (Moro et al. 2006), therefore supporting possible indirect inactivation of BRCA2 in tumors from patient RA45. A recent comprehensive genomic analysis of prostate cancer also revealed somatic alterations of the BRCA2 locus in prostate tumors (Taylor et al. 2010). Taken together, these data suggest that somatic alterations contribute to BRCA2 inactivation in metastatic prostate tumors from three independent patients. These data could have significant clinical and therapeutic implications for metastatic prostate cancer. Recent clinical trials have shown dramatic efficacy for PARP inhibitors in tumors from breast-cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations (Fong et al. 2009). Therefore, deep genomic interrogation of prostate tumors could identify patients with somatic alterations, resulting in BRCA2 inactivation that might be candidates for PARP inhibitors; however, this hypothesis would need to be tested by substantive preclinical studies.  Our study has also revealed additional novel candidate oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in lethal metastatic tumors. We identified a focal homozygous deletion at 13q14.12 spanning 279 Kb in metastatic lesion RA48RM that contained seven genes including C13ORF15 (Table 2), which encodes RGC32. Although RGC32 has been reported as overexpressed in some tumor types (Fosbrink et al. 2005), it has also been strongly implicated as a tumor-suppressor gene in glioma (Saigusa et al. 2007). Saigusa et al. (2007) reported that C13ORF15 mapped within a 13q14.11 region of frequent loss in glioma and showed that RGC32 is induced by p53 in response to DNA damage. They further reported an inverse correlation between C13ORF15 mRNA and tumor grade in primary astrocytomas, especially in tumors with p53 mutation (Saigusa et al. 2007). Furthermore, they demonstrated that overexpression of RGC32 suppressed glioma cell growth in vitro, further supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Saigusa et al. 2007). An independent 279-kb homozygous deletion at 13q14.12 in another tumor (RA49LT) contained only two genes, including SIAH3, which encodes a member of the seven in absentia (Sina) protein family. These are RING-containing proteins that function as E3 ubiquitin ligases (Hu et al. 1997; Venables et al. 2004). Although SIAH3 has not been characterized functionally, SIAH1 cooperates with SIP (Siah-interacting protein), EBI, and the adaptor protein SKP1, to target beta-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation via a p53-dependent mechanism (Matsuzawa and Reed 2001).  Of the genes somatically mutated in our sample set, only two were mutated in more than one patient, including TP53 and CHD5 (Table 3). CHD5 is a member of the SNF2/RAD54 helicase family, which contains a SWI/SNF-like helicase/ATPase domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a chromodomain involved in chromatin modification for tissue-specific gene expression (Thompson et al. 2003). Importantly, CHD5 has recently been implicated as a tumor-suppressor gene in neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, and gastric cancer (Bagchi et al. 2007; Gorringe et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009). Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that CHD5 loss is associated with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis via the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway (Bagchi et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009). Inactivation of CHD5 can occur through copy number deletion, somatic point mutation, and promoter methylation in other tumor types (Bagchi et al. 2007; Gorringe et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009). Interestingly, in ovarian cancer, somatic point mutations were reported as heterozygous, where the wild-type allele was inactivated by hypermethylation (Gorringe et al. 2008). This seems consistent with our findings, as the two mutations discovered in our study were both heterozygous. Our data support a probable role for CHD5 in prostate tumorigenesis. Additionally, a nonsense mutation was discovered in the ARHGEF12 gene, which encodes the leukemia-associated RHO-GEF, LARG. This gene is fused with MLL in acute myeloid leukemia and is believed to play a role in the regulation of RhoA GTPase (Kourlas et al. 2000). Importantly, there is significant evidence in the literature showing that regulation of Rho by LARG is through direct interaction with plexin-B1, which is involved in invasive growth and cell migration, and most importantly, is mutated in metastatic prostate cancer (Aurandt et al. 2002; Hirotani et al. 2002; Swiercz et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2007). Taken together, these data suggest that Rho signaling may be perturbed in metastatic prostate tumors through several mechanisms, among which would be mutations in plexin-B1 or LARG.  We analyzed copy number and mutational analysis data from three independent metastatic lesions from a single patient (RA45) to determine whether or not we could find evidence that these tumors were derived from a common progenitor tumor cell, or whether they were derived from independent tumor cells. Systemic sites for these three tumors from patient RA45 can be found in Table 1. Analysis of our genomic data support evidence for a common progenitor clone with site-specific divergence among these three tumors. Evidence supporting the common progenitor models comes from the fact that all three clones share identical high-level focal amplifications at 5p and 14q, strongly supporting their derivation from a common ancestral progenitor tumor cell. As stated previously, these are focal events at 5p (\\u223c850 kb) and 14q (\\u223c1.6 Mb), and harbor only 10 and five genes, respectively. At the copy number state, the 5p and 14q amplicons along with 10p whole-arm gain, 10q interstitial deletion, and 8q whole arm gain represent alterations shared among all three clones. Next generation sequencing data further supports the model for a common progenitor, where mutational analysis revealed common somatic point mutations across all three tumors in both the TP53 and MTOR genes (Table 3). Although data support a common progenitor model for these three metastatic lesions from this patient, further analysis revealed site-specific divergence within the tumors at the three independent sites. Tumors RA45M and RA45RM share several common alterations, including an interstitial deletion at 18q, which is not present in RA45AT (Supplemental Fig. 1). Other common alterations shared only between RA45M and RA45RM include 1q21\\u2013q22 gain, 9q34.3 gain, 8p whole arm loss, and a 17p11.2 interstitial deletion (data not shown). We also uncovered copy number aberrations that are specific to each tumor, including a focal region of gain at 19p12 that is specific to RA45RM, and an interstitial deletion of 21q21 that is specific to RA45M (Supplemental Fig. 1). Taken together, the genomic analysis of these three metastatic lesions from patient RA45 suggest that all three tumors were likely derived from a common progenitor clone. These results would suggest that the oldest clone of the three is RA45AT, as this clone only contains alterations shared among all three clones. Our data also suggest that tumors RA45M and RA45RM probably diverged from a younger clone, as they contain additional common alterations not present in RA45AT, but these two tumors also diverged independently at their respective system sites, evidenced by clonal-specific alterations within RA45M and RA45RM. What we cannot determine from these data is whether the progenitor clone for these three metastatic lesions came from the primary site, or whether the progenitor clone derived at a specific distant site. As access to the primary tumor from this patient is not available, we are unable to reconcile this issue.  In summary, we have completed a detailed genomic analysis of the lethal variety of metastatic prostate tumors. Our study relied on high-resolution aCGH, which uncovered focal copy number events. We also used novel state-of-the-art approaches for targeted mutational analysis facilitated by NGS technologies. These NGS technologies provide a very sensitive and powerful method for detecting mutations even in highly heterogeneous tissue specimens. Our data has validated previous findings in metastatic prostate cancer, including the involvement of specific chromosomal copy number changes and the model of multiple systemic lesions in a single patient being derived from a common progenitor tumor cell. Our study has revealed candidate tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that are perturbed by copy number change or point mutation that may be implicated in the aggressive lethal phenotype of some prostate tumors. Finally, several of the alterations discovered in our study could have downstream clinical and therapeutic implications for metastatic prostate cancer. Although our study contained a relatively small number of tumors, we have gleaned new insights and taken a glimpse into the genomic landscape of lethal metastatic prostate tumors. However, these data will need to be validated in a larger cohort of patients and tumor specimens in order to search for the true drivers of lethal metastatic disease and to link these alterations to disease progression and understand their role in early disease. Interestingly, a recent study was published describing a comprehensive genomic analysis of more than 200 prostate tumors, including 17 metastatic lesions using CGH and Sanger sequencing methods. Of the 17 metastatic tumors, five were analyzed for copy number changes and mutational analysis (Taylor et al. 2010). Their study implicated a number of genomic regions and genes also discovered in our study such as copy number changes (SKP2, PTEN, TP53) and mutations (BRCA2, TP53). However, our study also has revealed several unique genomic alterations possibly important in lethal metastatic disease. The alterations and candidate genes will need to be functionally validated to confirm their role in prostate tumorigenesis, and their effects on either invasion, migration, or metastatic potential. With the new opportunities for more cost-effective deep whole-genome sequencing, we, and others, are now poised to uncover the full compendium of somatic alterations driving lethal prostate cancer, and perhaps provide new clues on how to best treat these essentially deadly tumors.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, leading to an estimated 1.4\\u2009million deaths in 2010 (ref. 1). The discovery of recurrent mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase, as well as fusions involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has led to a marked change in the treatment of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer2, 3, 4, 5. More recent data have suggested that targeting mutations in BRAF, AKT1, ERBB2 and PIK3CA and fusions that involve ROS1 and RET may also be successful6, 7. Unfortunately, activating mutations in EGFR and ALK fusions are typically not present in the second most common type of lung cancer, lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC)8, and targeted agents developed for lung adenocarcinoma are largely ineffective against lung SQCC.Although no comprehensive genomic analysis of lung SQCCs has been reported, single-platform studies have identified regions of somatic copy number alterations in lung SQCCs, including amplification of SOX2, PDGFRA and FGFR1 and/or WHSC1L1 and deletion of CDKN2A9, 10. DNA sequencing studies of lung SQCCs have reported recurrent mutations in several genes, including TP53, NFE2L2, KEAP1, BAI3, FBXW7, GRM8, MUC16, RUNX1T1, STK11 and ERBB4 (refs 11, 12). DDR2 mutations and FGFR1 amplification have been nominated as therapeutic targets13, 14, 15.We have conducted a comprehensive study of lung SQCCs from a large cohort of patients as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The twin aims are to characterize the genomic and epigenomic landscape of lung SQCC and to identify potential opportunities for therapy. We report an integrated analysis based on DNA copy number, somatic exonic mutations, messenger RNA sequencing, mRNA expression and promoter methylation for 178 histopathologically reviewed lung SQCCs, in addition to whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 19 samples and microRNA sequencing of 159 samples (Supplementary Table 1.1). Demographic and clinical data and results of the genomic analyses can be downloaded from the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/lusc_2012/).Samples and clinical dataAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsTumour samples were obtained from 178 patients with previously untreated stage I\\u2013IV lung SQCC. Germline DNA was obtained from adjacent, histologically normal tissues resected at the time of surgery (n = 137) or from peripheral blood (n = 41). All patients provided written informed consent to conduct genomic studies in accordance with local Institutional Review Boards. The demographic characteristics are described in Supplementary Table 1.2. The median follow-up for the cohort was 15.8\\u2009months, and 60% of patients were alive at the time of the last follow-up (data updated in November 2011). Ninety-six per cent of the patients had a history of tobacco use, similar to previous reports for North American patients with lung SQCC16. DNA and RNA were extracted from patient specimens and measured by several genomic assays, which included standard quality-control assessments (Supplementary Methods, sections 2\\u20138). A committee of experts in lung cancer pathology performed a further review of all samples to confirm the histological subtype (Supplementary Fig. 1.1 and Supplementary Methods, section 1).Somatic DNA alterationsAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsThe lung SQCCs analysed in this study display a large number and variety of DNA alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 323 altered copy number segments and 165 genomic rearrangements per tumour.Copy number alterations were analysed using several platforms. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 6.0 array data across the set of 178 lung SQCCs identified a high rate of copy number alteration (mean of 323 segments) when compared with other TCGA projects (as of 1 February 2012), including ovarian cancer (477 segments)17, glioblastoma multiforme (282 segments)18, colorectal carcinoma (213 segments), breast carcinoma (282 segments) and renal cell carcinoma (156 segments) (P\\u2009<\\u20091\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u221215 by Fisher\\u2019s exact test). These segments gave rise to regions of both focal and broad somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), with a mean of 47 focal and 23 broad events per tumour (broad events defined as\\u2009\\u226550% of the length of the chromosome arm). There was strong concordance between the three independent copy number assays for all regions of SCNA (Supplementary Figs 2.1\\u20132.4).At the level of whole chromosome arm SCNAs, lung SQCCs exhibit many similarities to 205 cases of lung adenocarcinoma analysed by TCGA (Supplementary Fig. 2.1a). The most notable difference between these cancers is selective amplification of chromosome 3q in lung SQCC, as has been reported9, 19. Using the SNP 6.0 array platform and GISTIC 2.0 (refs 20, 21), we identified regions of significant copy number alteration (Supplementary Methods, section 2). There were 50 peaks of significant amplification or deletion (Q\\u2009<\\u20090.05), several of which included SCNAs previously seen in lung SQCCs including SOX2, PDGFRA and/or KIT, EGFR, FGFR1 and/or WHSC1L1, CCND1 and CDKN2A9, 10, 19 (Supplementary Fig. 2.1b and Supplementary Data 2.1 and 2.2). Other peaks defined regions of SCNA reported for the first time, including amplifications of chromosomal segments containing NFE2L2, MYC, CDK6, MDM2, BCL2L1 and EYS and deletions of FOXP1, PTEN and NF1 (Supplementary Fig. 2.1b).Whole exome sequencing of 178 lung SQCCs and matched germline DNA targeted 193,094 exons from 18,863 genes. The mean sequencing coverage across targeted bases was 121\\u00d7, with 83% of target bases above 30\\u00d7 coverage. We identified a total of 48,690 non-silent mutations with a mean of 228 non-silent and 360 total exonic mutations per tumour, corresponding to a mean somatic mutation rate of 8.1 mutations per megabase (Mb) and median of 8.4 per Mb. That rate is higher than rates observed in other TCGA projects including acute myelogenous leukaemia (0.56 per Mb), breast carcinoma (1.0 per Mb), ovarian cancer17 (2.1 per Mb), glioblastoma multiforme18 (2.3 per Mb) and colorectal carcinoma (3.2 per Mb) (data as of 1 February 2012, P\\u2009<\\u20092.2\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u221216 by t-test or Wilcoxon\\u2019s rank sum test for lung SQCC versus all others). In lung SQCC, CpG transitions and transversions were the most commonly observed mutation types, with mean rates of 9.9 and 10.7 per sequenced megabase of CpG context, respectively, for a total mutation rate of 20.6 per Mb. At non-CpG sites, transversions at C:G sites were more common than transitions (7.3 versus 2.9 per Mb; total = 10.2 per Mb) and more common than transversions or transitions at A:T sites (1.5 versus 1.3 per Mb; total = 2.8 per Mb).Significantly mutated genes were identified using a modified version of the MutSig algorithm (Supplementary Methods, section 3)22, 23. We identified 10 genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) Q value <\\u20090.1 (Supplementary Table 3.1): TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, KEAP1, MLL2, HLA-A, NFE2L2, NOTCH1 and RB1, all of which demonstrated robust evidence of gene expression as defined by reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) >\\u20091 (Fig. 1). TP53 mutation was observed in 81% of samples by automated analysis; visual review of sequencing reads identified a further 9% of samples with potential mutations in regions of sub-optimal coverage or in samples with low purity. Most observed mutations in NOTCH1 (8 out of 17) were truncating alterations, suggesting loss-of-function, as has recently been reported for head and neck SQCCs22, 24. Mutations in HLA-A were also almost exclusively nonsense or splice site events (7 out of 8).Figure 1: Significantly mutated genes in lung SQCC.Significantly mutated genes in lung SQCC.Significantly mutated genes (Q\\u2009value\\u2009<\\u20090.1) identified by exome sequencing are listed vertically by Q value.

This yielded 12 other genes with FDR <\\u20090.1: FAM123B (also known as WTX), HRAS, FBXW7, SMARCA4, NF1, SMAD4, EGFR, APC, TSC1, BRAF, TNFAIP3 and CREBBP (Supplementary Table 3.1). Both the spectrum and the frequency of EGFR mutations differed from those seen in lung adenocarcinomas. The two most common alterations in lung adenocarcinoma, Leu858Arg and inframe deletions in exon 19, were absent, whereas two Leu861Gln mutations were detected in EGFR.As described in Supplementary Fig. 3.1, we verified somatic mutations by performing an independent hybrid-recapture of 76 genes in all samples. A total of 1,289 mutations were assayed, and we achieved satisfactory coverage to have power to verify at 1,283 positions. We validated 1,235 mutations (96.2%) (Supplementary Fig. 3.1 and Supplementary Methods, section 3). We also verified mutation calls using WGS and RNA sequencing data with similar results (Supplementary Figs 3.1, 4.3 and Supplementary Methods, sections 3 and 4).WGS was performed for 19 tumour/normal pairs with a mean computed coverage of 54\\u00d7. A mean of 165 somatic rearrangements was found per lung SQCC tumour pair (Supplementary Fig. 3.2), a value in excess of that reported for WGS studies of other tumour types including colorectal carcinoma (75)25, prostate carcinoma (108)26, multiple myeloma (21)23 and breast cancer (90)27. Although most inframe coding fusions detected in WGS were validated by RNA sequencing, no recurrent rearrangements predicted to generate fusion proteins were identified (Supplementary Data 3.1 and 4.1).Somatically altered pathwaysAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsMany of the somatic alterations we have identified in lung SQCCs seem to be drivers of pathways important to the initiation or progression of the cancer. Specifically, genes involved in the oxidative stress response and squamous differentiation were frequently altered by mutation or SCNA. We observed mutations and copy number alterations of NFE2L2 and KEAP1 and/or deletion or mutation of CUL3 in 34% of cases (Fig. 2). NFE2L2 and KEAP1 code for proteins that bind to each other, have been shown to regulate the cell response to oxidative damage, chemo- and radiotherapy, and are somatically altered in a variety of cancer types28, 29. We found mutations in NFE2L2 almost exclusively in one of two KEAP1 interaction motifs, DLG or ETGE. Mutations in KEAP1 and CUL3 showed a pattern consistent with loss-of-function and were mutually exclusive with mutations in NFE2L2 (Figs 1c and 2). PARADIGM SHIFT30 analysis predicts that mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 exert a considerable functional effect (Supplementary Fig. 7.C.1, 7.C.2 and Supplementary Methods, section 7).Figure 2: Somatically altered pathways in squamous cell lung cancer.Somatically altered pathways in squamous cell lung cancer.Left, alterations in oxidative stress response pathway genes as defined by somatic mutation, copy number alteration or up- or downregulation.

Although NOTCH1 has been well characterized as an oncogene in haematological cancers31, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 truncating mutations have been reported in cutaneous SQCCs and lung SQCCs32. Truncating mutations in ASCL4 are the first to be reported in human cancer and may have a lineage role given the requirement for ASCL1 for survival of small-cell lung cancer cells33. Alterations in NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and ASCL4 were mutually exclusive and exhibited minimal overlap with amplification of TP63 and/or SOX2 (Fig. 2), suggesting that aberrations in those modulators of squamous cell differentiation have overlapping functional consequences.mRNA expression profiling and subtype classificationAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsWhole-transcriptome expression profiles were generated by RNA sequencing for the entire cohort and by microarrays for a 121-sample subset. Of 20,502 genes analysed, the mean RNA coverage indices were 19\\u00d7 and 6,420\\u2009RPKM (Supplementary Fig. 4.1 and Supplementary Methods, section 4). Previously reported lung SQCC gene expression-subtype signatures34 were applied to both of the expression platforms, yielding four subtypes designated as classical (36%), basal (25%), secretory (24%) and primitive (15%). The concordance of subtypes between the two platforms was high (94% agreement) (Supplementary Fig. 4.2). Considerable correlations were found between the expression subtypes and genomic alterations in copy number, mutation and methylation (Fig. 3). The classical subtype was characterized by alterations in KEAP1, NFE2L2 and PTEN, as well as pronounced hypermethylation and chromosomal instability. The 3q26 amplicon was present in all of the subtypes, but it was most characteristic of the classical subtype, which also showed the greatest overexpression of three known oncogenes on 3q: SOX2, TP63 and PIK3CA. RNA sequencing data suggested that high expression levels of TP63, in samples with and without amplification of TP63, were associated with dominant expression of the deltaN isoform (also called p40), which lacks the amino-terminal transactivation domain, compared with the longer isoform, called tap63 (89% of tumours overexpressed deltaN compared with tap63; P\\u2009<\\u20092.2\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u221216). The short deltaN isoform is thought to function as an oncogene35, 36, and its expression was most enriched in the classical subtype. By contrast, the primitive expression subtype more commonly exhibited RB1 and PTEN alterations, and the basal expression subtype showed NF1 alterations (Fig. 3). Amplification of FGFR1 and WHSC1L1 was anticorrelated with the classical subtype and specifically with NFE2L2 or KEAP1 mutated samples. Although CDKN2A alterations are common in lung SQCCs, they are not associated with any particular expression subtype (Fig. 3).Figure 3: Gene expression subtypes integrated with genomic alterations.Gene expression subtypes integrated with genomic alterations.Tumours are displayed as columns, grouped by gene expression subtype. Subtypes were compared by Kruskal\\u2013Wallis tests for continuous features and by Fisher\\u2019s exact tests for categorical features. Displayed features showed significant association with gene expression subtype (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), except for CDKN2A alterations. deltaN percentage represents transcript isoform usage between the TP63 isoforms, deltaN and tap63, as determined by RNA sequencing. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined by the mean of the absolute values of chromosome arm copy numbers (CN) from the GISTIC23, 24 output. Absolute values are used so that amplification and deletion alterations are counted equally. Hypermethylation scores and iCluster assignments are described in Supplementary Figs 6.1 and 7.A1, respectively.

The highest overall methylation was seen in the classical subtype (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs 5.1 and 6.1, Supplementary Methods, sections 5 and 6, Supplementary Data 6.1 and 6.2 and Supplementary Table 5.1). Integrative clustering (iCluster)37 of mRNA, miRNA, methylation, SCNA and mutation data demonstrated concordance with the mRNA expression subtypes and associated alterations (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 7.A.1 and Supplementary Methods, section 7). Independent correlation of somatic mutations, copy number alterations and gene expression signatures revealed notable subtype associations with alterations in the TP53, PI3K, RB1 and NFE2L2/KEAP1 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 7.B.1 and Supplementary Methods, section 7).Analysis of the CDKN2A locusAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsIntegrated multiplatform analyses showed that CDKN2A, a known tumour suppressor gene in lung SQCC38 that encodes the p16INK4A and p14ARF proteins, is inactivated in 72% of cases of lung SQCC (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 7.1)\\u2014by epigenetic silencing by methylation (21%), inactivating mutation (18%), exon 1\\u03b2 skipping (4%) and homozygous deletion (29%).Figure 4: Multi-faceted characterization of mechanisms of CDKN2A loss.Multi-faceted characterization of mechanisms of CDKN2A loss.a, Schematic view of the exon structure of CDKN2A demonstrating the types of alterations identified in the study.

Almost all of the cases completely lacking p16INK4 and ARF expression showed homozygous deletion (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 7.1). In one case, p16INK4 expression was detected but analysis of WGS data demonstrated an intergenic fusion event that resulted in detectable transcription between exon 1\\u03b1 p16INK4 and exon 18 of KIAA1797 (Fig. 4b, c). Interestingly, combined analysis of WGS and RNA sequencing data identified tumour suppressor gene inactivation by intra- or interchromosomal rearrangement in PTEN, NOTCH1, ARID1A, CTNNA2, VHL and NF1, in eight further cases (Supplementary Data 3.1 and 4.1).In addition to homozygous deletion, there are frequent mutational events in CDKN2A (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 7.1). These account for 45% of the 56 cases with high p16INK4 and ARF expression. Furthermore, methylation of the exon 1\\u03b1 promoter accounts for many other cases of CDKN2A inactivation (70% of lung SQCCs with ARF expression in the absence of detectable p16INK4). Seven other tumours in the high-ARF/low-INK4A group had documented mutations of INK4A, primarily nonsense mutations, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay as a mechanism. Of the 28% of tumours without CDKN2A alterations, RB1 mutations were identified in eight cases and CDK6 amplification in one case (Fig. 4d).Therapeutic targetsAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsMolecularly targeted agents are now commonly used in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung, whereas no effective targeted agents have been developed specifically for lung SQCCs13. We analysed our genomic data for evidence of the two common genomic alterations in adenocarcinomas of the lung: EGFR and KRAS mutations. Only one sample had a KRAS codon 61 mutation, and there were no exon 19 deletions or Leu858Arg mutations in EGFR. However, amplifications of EGFR were found in 7% of cases, as were two instances of the Leu861Gln EGFR mutation, which confers sensitivity to erlotinib and gefitinib39.The presence of new potential therapeutic targets in lung SQCC was suggested by the observation that 96% (171 out of 178) of tumours contain one or more mutations in tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) catalytic and regulatory subunits, nuclear hormone receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, proteases and tyrosine phosphatases (Supplementary Fig. 7.D.1a and Supplementary Data 7.2 and 7.3). From 50 to 77% of the mutations were predicted to have a medium or high functional effect as determined by the mutation assessor score40 (Supplementary Fig. 7.D.1a), and 39% of tyrosine and 42% of serine/threonine kinase mutations were located in the kinase domain. Many of the alterations were in known oncogenes and tumour suppressors, as defined in the COSMIC database (Supplementary Data 7.3).We selected potential therapeutic targets based on several features, including (1) availability of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted therapeutic agent or one under study in current clinical trials (Supplementary Data 7.2); (2) confirmation of the altered allele in RNA sequencing; and (3) the mutation assessor score40. Using those criteria, we identified 114 cases with somatic alteration of a potentially targetable gene (64%) (Supplementary Fig. 7.D.1b and Supplementary Data 7.4). Among these, we identified three families of tyrosine kinases, the erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologues (ERBBs), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and Janus kinases (JAKs), all of which were found to be mutated and/or amplified41. As discussed for EGFR, the mutational spectra in these potential therapeutic targets differed from those in lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Fig. 7.D.2)42.To complement a gene-centred search for potential therapeutic targets, we analysed core cellular pathways known to represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities: PI(3)K/AKT, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS. Analysis of the 178 lung SQCCs revealed alteration in at least one of those pathways in 69% of samples after restriction of the analysis to mutations confirmed by RNA sequencing and to amplifications associated with overexpression of the target gene (Fig. 5). Mutational events that have been curated in COSMIC are also shown in Supplementary Fig. 7D.2, as is the distribution of mutations, amplifications and overexpression of the genes depicted in Fig. 5. (A summary of all samples and their significant mutations and copy number alterations, including alterations in Fig. 5, is shown in Supplementary Data 7.5.) Specifically, one of the components of the PI(3)K/AKT pathway was altered in 47% of tumours and RTK signalling probably affected by events such as EGFR amplification, BRAF mutation or FGFR amplification or mutation in 26% of tumours (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 7.D.3). Alterations in the PI(3)K/AKT pathway genes were mutually exclusive with EGFR alterations as identified by MEMo43 (Supplementary Fig. 7.D.4.). Although the dependence of lung SQCC on many of these individual alterations remains to be defined functionally, this analysis suggests new areas for potential therapeutic development in this cancer.Figure 5: Alterations in targetable oncogenic pathways in lung SQCCs.Alterations in targetable oncogenic pathways in lung SQCCs.Pathway diagram showing the percentage of samples with alterations in the PI(3)K/RTK/RAS pathways.

Similar to high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma17, almost all lung SQCCs display somatic mutation of TP53. There were also frequent alterations in the following pathways: CDKN2A/RB1, NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3, PI3K/AKT and SOX2/TP63/NOTCH1 pathways, providing evidence of common dysfunction in cell cycle control, response to oxidative stress, apoptotic signalling and/or squamous cell differentiation. Pathway alterations clustered according to expression-subtype in many cases, suggesting that those subtypes have a biological basis.A role for somatic mutation in the cancer hallmark of avoiding immune destruction44 is suggested by the presence of inactivating mutations in the HLA-A gene. Somatic loss-of-function alterations of HLA-A have not been reported previously in genomic studies of lung cancer. Given the recently reported efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD1)45 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies in non-small-cell lung cancer46, these HLA-A mutations suggest a possible role for genotypic selection of patients for immunotherapies.Targeted kinase inhibitors have been successfully used for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma but minimally so in lung SQCC. The observations reported here suggest that a detailed understanding of the possible targets in lung SQCCs may identify targeted therapeutic approaches. Whereas EGFR and KRAS mutations, the two most common oncogenic aberrations in lung adenocarcinoma, are extremely rare in lung SQCC, alterations in the FGFR kinase family are common. Lung SQCCs also share many alterations in common with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas without evidence of human papilloma virus infection, including mutation in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1 and HRAS22, 24, suggesting that the biology of these two diseases may be similar.The current study has identified a potentially targetable gene or pathway alteration in most lung SQCC samples studied. The data presented here can help to organize efforts to analyse lung SQCC clinical tumour specimens for a panel of specific, actionable mutations to select patients for appropriately targeted clinical trials. These data could thereby help to facilitate effective personalized therapy for this deadly disease.MethodsAbstract\\u2022 Introduction\\u2022 Samples and clinical data\\u2022 Somatic DNA alterations\\u2022 Somatically altered pathways\\u2022 mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification\\u2022 Analysis of the CDKN2A locus\\u2022 Therapeutic targets\\u2022 Discussion\\u2022 Methods\\u2022 References\\u2022 Acknowledgements\\u2022 Author information\\u2022 Supplementary information\\u2022 CommentsAll specimens were obtained from patients with appropriate consent from the relevant Institutional Review Board. DNA and RNA were collected from samples using the Allprep kit (Qiagen). We used commercial technology for capture and sequencing of exomes from tumour DNA and normal DNA and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Significantly mutated genes were identified by comparing them with expectation models based on the exact measured rates of specific sequence lesions. GISTIC23, 24 analysis of the circular-binary-segmented Affymetrix SNP 6.0 copy number data was used to identify recurrent amplification and deletion peaks. Consensus clustering approaches were used to analyse mRNA, miRNA and methylation subtypes using previous approaches20, 21, 34, 38, 41, 44. The analysis of exonic DNA from prostate cancers has identified recurrently mutated genes, but the spectrum of genome-wide alterations has not been profiled extensively in this disease. We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term \\u201cchromoplexy\\u201d, frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Though often curable at early stages, clinically advanced prostate cancer causes over 250,000 deaths worldwide annually (Jemal et al., 2011). Identifying prostate cancers that require aggressive treatment and gaining durable control of advanced disease comprise two pressing public health needs. A deeper understanding of the molecular genetic changes that occur during the development of invasive and metastatic tumors may provide useful insights into these problems.  Genetic studies of prostate cancer have revealed numerous recurrent DNA alterations that dysregulate genes involved in prostatic development, chromatin modification, cell cycle regulation and androgen signaling, among other processes (Baca and Garraway, 2012). Chromosomal deletions accumulate early in prostate carcinogenesis and commonly inactivate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) such as PTEN, TP53 and CDKN1B (Shen and Abate-Shen, 2010). In addition, recent exome sequencing of localized and castration-resistant prostate cancer has identified base-pair mutations in genes such as SPOP, FOXA1 and KDM6A, which implicate a range of deregulated cellular processes in prostate tumor development (Barbieri et al., 2012; Grasso et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2011).  Structural genomic rearrangements also play a critical role in prostate carcinogenesis. Roughly half of prostatic adenocarcinomas overexpress an oncogenic ETS transcription factor gene (most commonly ERG) due to somatic fusion with a constitutively active or androgen-regulated promoter (Tomlins et al., 2007; Tomlins et al., 2005). In addition, disruptive rearrangements may inactivate TSGs such as PTEN or MAGI2 (Berger et al., 2011). Interestingly, analysis of prostate cancer genomes has revealed complex \\u201cchains\\u201d of rearrangements, which may result when broken DNA ends are shuffled and re-ligated to one another in a novel configuration (Berger et al., 2011). In theory, these DNA-shuffling events could simultaneously dysregulate multiple cancer genes, but the prevalence and consequences of rearrangement chains could not be assessed with the small panel of tumors sequenced.  Given the importance of structural genomic alterations in prostate cancer genesis and progression, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA copy number profiling of 57 prostate cancers to define a spectrum of oncogenic events that may operate during prostate tumor development. Through computational modeling of rearrangements and copy number alterations, we inferred that the chromosomal disarray in a typical tumor may accumulate over a handful of discrete events during tumor development. We employ the term \\u201cchromoplexy\\u201d to describe this putative phenomenon of complex genome restructuring (from the Greek pleko, meaning to weave or to braid). These complex rearrangement events occur in the majority of prostate cancers and may commonly inactivate multiple tumor-constraining genes in a coordinated fashion. This knowledge informs a model for punctuated tumor evolution relevant to prostate cancer and possibly other malignancies.  Go to: RESULTS The Landscape of Genomic Rearrangement in Prostate Cancer  We sequenced the genomes of 55 primary prostate adenocarcinomas and two neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) metastases that developed following castration-based therapy, along with paired normal tissue. We selected treatment-na\\u00efve adenocarcinomas across a range of clinically relevant tumor grades and stages (Gleason score 6 through 9; pathological stage pT2N0 through pT4N1; Table S1). Roughly 1.68\\u00d71013 sequenced base pairs aligned uniquely to the hg19 human reference genome (Table S2). Sequencing of tumor and normal DNA to mean coverage depths of 61x and 34x, respectively, revealed 356,136 somatic base-pair mutations, with an average of 33 non-silent exonic mutations per primary tumor (Figure 1 and Table S3A). We profiled somatic DNA copy number alterations (SCNAs) with high-density oligonucleotide arrays (Table S3B). Additionally, we conducted transcriptome sequencing on 20 tumors, along with matched benign prostate tissue for 16 cases.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Somatic Alterations in 57 Prostate Tumor Genomes To identify genomic rearrangements, we analyzed paired-end sequencing reads that map to the reference genome in unexpected orientations using the dRanger algorithm (Berger et al., 2011). We observed 5596 high-confidence rearrangements that were absent from normal DNA in both this cohort and an extended panel of 172 non-cancerous genome sequences (Figure 1 and Table S3C). We validated 113 rearrangements by re-sequencing and/or PCR amplification of tumor and normal DNA (Table S3C). We did not discover novel recurrent gene fusions, but observed several singleton events that may lead to overexpression of oncogenes. For example, sense-preserving fusions joined NRF1 to BRAF (PR-4240) and CRKL to the ERK-2 kinase gene MAPK1 (P04-1084; Figure S1A), leaving the kinase domains of BRAF and MAPK1 primarily intact. Several genes underwent recurrent disruptive rearrangements with potential biological consequence, such as PTEN, RB1, GSK3B and FOXO1 (Figure S1 and Table S4). Thus, rearrangement of these genes may contribute to the development of localized prostate cancer.  DNA Deletions and Rearrangements Reveal Signatures of Complex Genome-Restructuring Events  Rearrangements involving cancer gene loci often occurred in the context of a \\u201cchain\\u201d, in which the two rearrangement breakpoints map to the reference genome near breakpoints from other rearrangements (Figure 2A, left). Such characteristic breakpoint distributions were observed in our initial study of seven prostate cancer genomes (Berger et al., 2011) and appear to reflect collections of broken DNA ends that are shuffled and ligated to one another in an aberrant configuration. Given the involvement of prostate cancer genes in rearrangement chains, we set out to survey chained rearrangements systematically to clarify their prevalence and potential biological consequences.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Integrated Analysis of Genomic Deletions and Rearrangements Reveals Signatures of Concurrent Alterations We first determined whether additional chains could be identified by integrative analysis of chromosomal deletions and rearrangements. Although rearrangement chains may arise with minimal loss of genetic material, substantial DNA deletions were often evident at the fusion junctions of chained rearrangements (Figure 2A, right). When these deletions are overlaid with somatic rearrangement locations on the reference genome, the deletions create \\u201cbridges\\u201d that span the sequence between breakpoints from two different fusions (Figure 2A, bottom right). In all informative tumors in our cohort, the breakpoints at either end of a deletion were more often fused to novel partners rather than to each other (thus creating \\u201cdeletion bridges\\u201d, rather than \\u201csimple deletions\\u201d; Figure S2A). Importantly, this observation indicates that the many rearrangements demonstrating DNA loss near a breakpoint may be linked by deletion bridges to additional rearrangements in a chain.  We next considered whether rearrangements in a chain might arise independently of one another, for instance, at loci that are predisposed toward fusion due to DNA secondary structure or nuclear proximity (Burrow et al., 2010; De and Michor, 2011). To investigate this, we created a probabilistic model for the independent generation of detectible rearrangements across the genome (Figure S2B). Using this model, we calculated the probability that any pair of neighboring DNA breakpoints X and Y would arise independently of each other (PXY) based on (1) their reference genome distance and (2) the local rate of rearrangements observed in our tumor panel (Figure 2B). As a control, we created ten simulated genomes for each tumor, with rearrangement locations matched for chromosome, local gene expression levels, sequence guanine/cytosine content and DNA replication timing, among other factors (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In addition, we generated \\u201cscrambled\\u201d genomes by combining rearrangements from distinct tumors, preserving locus-specific effects that may promote double strand breakage. The observed rearrangements, but not the simulated or scrambled data, showed marked deviation from the independent model (Figure S2C) and statistical enhancement of chain-like patterns (Figure 2B). For 50% of rearrangements, the reference genome locations of both breakpoints were nearer to breakpoints of additional rearrangements than would be expected by chance (p < 10\\u22124 for observed versus simulated or scrambled PXY values). To the extent that our model correctly predicts the genomic distribution of independent rearrangements, these results suggest that rearrangement chains are unlikely to arise from independent events, thus raising the hypothesis that they occur by a coordinated process.  \\u201cChromoplexy\\u201d Generates Chained Chromosomal Rearrangements and Deletions  Having identified chained patterns of rearrangements that may result from interdependent alterations, we created an algorithm called ChainFinder to search for such events systematically (Figures 3A and S3). ChainFinder employs a statistically based search rooted in graph theory to identify genomic rearrangements and associated deletions that deviate significantly from our independent model described above, and thus appear to have arisen in an interdependent fashion (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).  Figure 3 Figure 3 The ChainFinder Algorithm We used ChainFinder to survey our panel of prostate tumors for rearrangement chains. Strikingly, this analysis revealed numerous chains involving widely variable numbers of rearrangements. Some chains involved only three fusions, while others contained more than forty rearrangements that wove together five or more chromosomes (Table S5A; Figure 3B and S3C). We have termed the putative process of genomic restructuring that produces these complex chains \\u201cchromoplexy\\u201d (from the Greek pleko, meaning \\u201cto weave\\u201d or \\u201cto braid\\u201d). Chromoplectic chains of five or more rearrangements (ten or more breakpoints) were detected in 50 out of 57 tumors (88%; Table S5B and Figure S3C), while 36 tumors (63%) contained two or more such chains. Overall, 39% of rearrangements participated in chains, while ChainFinder detected chains in only 2.8% and 0.2% of rearrangements from simulated or scrambled genomes, respectively (Figure 3C\\u2013D). Thus, our statistical analysis of breakpoint distributions suggests that chromoplexy frequently generates multiple structural alterations in a coordinated fashion.  We noted profound phenotypic differences in chromoplexy in subsets of prostate cancers. Chromoplexy in tumors harboring oncogenic ETS fusions (ETS+) produced significantly more inter-chromosomal rearrangements than ETS\\u2212 tumors (p < 10\\u22124) and involved a greater maximum number of chromosomes in a single event (p = 0.009; Figure 4A\\u2013C). Interestingly, oncogenic ERG fusions frequently arose in the setting of chromoplexy (15 of 26 cases, 58%). Given that fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG occurs in the setting of androgen receptor-driven transcription (Haffner et al., 2010), the intricate chains in ETS+ tumors could reflect DNA injury at transcriptional hubs occupied by loci from multiple chromosomes. Consistent with this possibility, chromoplexy in ETS-positive nuclei primarily affected regions of the genome that are highly expressed in prostate tumors (Figure 4D) and that co-localize in interphase nuclei (Figure S4A). Thus, chromoplexy in ETS+ tumors appears to reflect a distinct process of genome restructuring that may be coupled to transcriptional processes.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Manifestations of Chromoplexy Vary by ETS Fusion Status In contrast, chromoplexy in a subset of ETS-negative cancers resembled chromothripsis (Rausch et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2011), a process of chromatin shattering yielding extensive DNA rearrangement, often of one or two focal chromosomal regions. In particular, seven ETS\\u2212 tumors contained up to seven-fold more rearrangements than the whole-cohort average (Figure S4B). These tumors harbored focal deletions or disruptive rearrangements involving the chromatin-modifying enzyme gene CHD1, a putative tumor-suppressor gene that may regulate genomic stability (Huang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012). The rearrangements in CHD1del tumors were predominantly intra-chromosomal both within chains (p = 2\\u00d710\\u22124) and overall (p = 4\\u00d710\\u22124; Figure S4C). Moreover, the rearrangements in CHD1del samples arose in late-replicating DNA with low guanine and cytosine content (Figure S4B), generally corresponding to gene-poor heterochromatin. An extended cohort of 199 prostate adenocarcinomas revealed that CHD1 loss was associated with an increased number of recurrent SCNAs (p = 1.5\\u00d710\\u22128) (Figure S4C). Given the postulated roles of CHD1 in genome stability and maintenance of chromatin architecture (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009), these findings raise the possibility that CHD1 deletion may contribute to the distinctive patterns of genomic instability observed in CHD1del tumors.  We investigated whether chromoplexy is unique to prostate cancer by analyzing a panel of 59 additional tumor genomes including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and breast adenocarcinoma (Table S5B and Figure S3C). Every tumor type demonstrated multiple instances of chains involving 5 or more rearrangements. Thus, a small number of chromoplectic events may account for the wide array of rearrangements and deletions in several common cancers.  Chromoplexy Commonly Dysregulates Cancer Genes  To assess the role of chromoplexy in prostate cancer development, we examined the genomic regions altered by deletion or disruptive rearrangements in the context of chains. Using a list of 17 potential prostate tumor suppressor genes from the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al., 2012), we found that 26 of the 57 tumors (46%) have either deletion or rearrangement of at least one gene in a chain of three or more rearrangements (Table S5C). Inclusion of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and 10 putative prostate cancer genes added 9 more samples. Several cancer genes were recurrently deleted or rearranged by chromoplexy, including PTEN (9 cases), NKX3-1 (8 cases), CDKN1B (3 cases), TP53 (4 cases), and RB1 (2 cases). Thus, chromoplexy may conceivably influence prostate carcinogenesis by disrupting tumor suppressor genes and creating oncogenic fusions.  The concurrent shuffling and deletion of multiple regions across the genome that appears to underlie chromoplexy could simultaneously inactivate tumor suppressor genes that are geographically distant from each other (i.e. on separate chromosomes). We noted several examples where multiple cancer genes were apparently disrupted by a single instance of chromoplexy. For instance, a chain of 27 rearrangements across 6 chromosomes included the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (21q) as well as a disruptive rearrangement of the prostate tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 (18q) (Ding et al., 2011) (Figures 5A and S5). In a second example, the adjacent CDKN1B/ETV6 tumor suppressor genes (12p) and the ETV3 locus (1q) were lost in the context of deletion bridges within one chain (Figure 5B). Additional instances of chromoplexy disrupted interacting genes in the same pathway: for instance, co-deletion of PIK3R1 (5q) with PTEN (10q) and TP53 (17p) with CHEK2 (22q) occurred in two chains (Table S5C). Thus, chromoplexy may simultaneously dysregulate multiple cancer genes across the genome. Such events may provide selective advantages to incipient cancer cells, particularly given that the loss of some TSGs promotes prostate cancer only in the context of specific accompanying molecular lesions (Chen et al., 2005).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Chromoplexy May Coordinately Dysregulate Multiple Cancer Genes Clonal Evolution Reveals Paths of Prostate Cancer Progression  To provide additional insight into the genomic evolution of prostate tumors, we analyzed the clonal status of mutations and deletions in our cohort. Using an approach related to previously described methods (Carter et al., 2012; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012), we exploited the extensive germline SNP genotype data provided by WGS to assess tumor purity and the clonal status of genomic lesions (Figures 6A and S6). Our estimates of tumor purity based on WGS matched those produced by ABSOLUTE analysis of SNP array data (Carter et al., 2012) (R2 = 0.99; p<10\\u22124), with the exception of two samples where admixed normal DNA was detected only from sequencing data (Table S1).  Figure 6 Figure 6 Clonality and Evolution of Prostate Cancer We first compared the clonality of deletions involving prostate cancer genes, reasoning that lesions that arise early in tumorigenesis or that foster rapid outgrowth would tend to be clonal, while late-arising deletions would more often be subclonal. Several common deletions were strictly clonal, including NKX3-1 and the 3Mb region of chromosome 21q that is frequently deleted to produce the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (Perner et al., 2006) (Figure 6B and Figure S6). These events are among the earliest detectible alterations in prostate cancer and are frequently observed in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a prostate cancer precursor lesion (Emmert-Buck et al., 1995; Perner et al., 2007). By contrast, deletions of PTEN were often subclonal (p = 10\\u22125 for comparison with NKX3-1 deletion clonality), as were CDKN1B deletions (Figure 6C). This finding suggests that PTEN and CDKN1B inactivation promotes the early progression of prostate cancer, consistent with the association of these events with higher-stage disease (Barbieri et al., 2012; Halvorsen et al., 2003).  We next used our clonality assessments to deconvolve the sequence of oncogenic events that gives rise to a typical prostate tumor. Reasoning that clonal alterations must originate prior to subclonal alterations within the same tumor, we examined pairs of genes that were deleted in the same sample across multiple tumors to determine the directionality of the clonal-subclonal hierarchy (Figure 6D). Where possible, we confirmed these relationships in independent exome-sequenced tumors. A \\u201cconsensus path\\u201d of progression emerged, beginning with events including deletion of NKX3-1 or FOXP1 and fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG. These lesions may disrupt normal prostate epithelial differentiation (Bhatia-Gaur et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2008) and effect other oncogenic perturbations. Thereafter, lesions in CDKN1B or TP53 accumulate; these alterations may lead to enhanced proliferation, genomic instability and/or evasion of apoptosis. Finally, loss of PTEN may provide a gating event in the development of aggressive prostate cancers. A similar assessment of point mutation clonality (Figure 6B, lower) revealed higher overall rates of subclonal events, with the exception of early mutations as in SPOP and FOXA1. Together, these results imply that prostate carcinogenesis favors the dysregulation of cancer genes in defined sequences, as has been suggested by studies of developing tumors in colon cancer (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990).  Next, we investigated whether chromoplexy might continue after cancer initiation, and thereby contribute to the progression of a tumor down an oncogenic path. Interestingly, several chains appeared to involve strictly subclonal deletion bridges (Figure S7A), indicating that tumors may sustain multiple rounds of chromoplexy. Together with the observation that chromoplexy may affect both early and late genes in the consensus path (e.g., ERG and PTEN) these findings suggest that chromoplexy also occurs in tumor subclones that emerge later during cancer evolution.  Prostate Cancer Genomic Derangement Increases with Histological Grade  Finally, we considered whether tumors with high-grade histology (indicative of high clinical risk) might occupy positions further along the consensus path. To this end, we quantified recurrent SCNAs in each genome by counting amplifications and deletions that overlapped with regions of significant SNCAs identified by GISTICv2 analysis (e.g., the TP53 and PTEN loci) across 199 tumors reported here and in a previous study (Barbieri et al., 2012; Mermel et al., 2011). Tumors with predominantly Gleason score (GS) 4 histology were significantly enriched for recurrent SCNAs compared to GS 3 tumors (p = 0.0059; Figure 6E) beyond the overall extent of SCNAs, despite similar purity of cancer DNA and mutational burden between the two groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that structural alterations affecting cancer genes, many of which result from chromoplexy, may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of high-grade prostate tumors.  Go to: DISCUSSION We have characterized somatic alterations across the genomes of 57 prostate tumors. By systematically profiling rearrangements and copy number alterations, we identified chromoplexy as a common process by which multiple geographically-distant genomic regions may be disrupted at once. Like other classes of complex genomic alterations (Stephens et al. 2011; Forment et al. 2012), chromoplexy was inferred from computational modeling, and its mechanistic underpinnings will need to be addressed experimentally. Chromoplexy is evident in several solid tumor types and in the majority of prostate cancers. In multiple instances, chromoplexy altered more than one cancer gene coordinately. In the future, systematic assessment of chromoplexy from WGS data could reveal groups of cancer gene alterations that confer a selective advantage when sustained all at once, but activate tumor-suppressing safeguards if sustained individually.  Although chained rearrangements could theoretically arise over multiple cellular generations by a \\u201csequential-dependent\\u201d mechanism, where the occurrence of each subsequent event depends on the presence of a prior event (Figure S7B), such a mechanism seems unlikely. In particular, a sequential-dependent model fails to account for the many complete or \\u201cclosed\\u201d chains we detected. For a closed chain to arise in a sequential-dependent manner, multiple junctions from ancestral somatic fusions would have to be re-broken precisely and fused to each other (Figure S7B) to complete the chain. Even if breakpoints in a chain could only fuse to one another, to generate the 121 observed closed chains in a sequential-dependent process would require immensely elevated rates of rearrangement in a focused region of the genome (up to ~103 times the maximum observed rate; Figure S7C\\u2013D). While we cannot exclude this possibility, plausible biological mechanism(s) could parsimoniously account for chained rearrangements within a single cell cycle, as discussed below.  A unifying feature of chromoplectic alterations is that they occur in a non-independent fashion; however multiple mechanisms may account for chromoplexy. Along these lines, our analyses have revealed distinctive patterns of chromoplexy in ETS\\u2212, CHD1del tumors. Tumors with deletion of CHD1 demonstrated an excess of intrachromosomal chained rearrangements and gene deletions, with DNA breakpoints enriched in GC-poor, late-replicating and non-expressed DNA. Previous reports have proposed that similar patterns may result from major DNA damaging events within heterochromatic nuclear compartments (Drier et al 2013). These tumors showed abundant, clustered rearrangements often affecting only one or two chromosomes with two alternating copy number states, perhaps indicating a chromothripsis-like process.  In contrast, chromoplexy in ETS+ tumors differed in the aggregate from chromothripsis in several critical ways. For example, single events joined DNA from dispersed regions of six or more chromosomes in multiple tumors, whereas chromothripsis frequently involves focal rearrangement of one or two chromosomes (Forment et al., 2012). Overall, chromoplexy appears more prevalent in ETS+ prostate cancer than chromothripsis is in any neoplasm (Stephens et al., 2011, Forment et al., 2012). Chromoplexy frequently involves fewer rearrangements than the \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d chromothripsis defined by Stephens et al., but may continue throughout tumor development. Our analysis of breakpoint locations in ETS+ tumors suggests that chromoplexy in this setting may be linked to proposed transcriptional DNA-damaging processes (Lin et al., 2009), potentially related to androgen receptor signaling. We stress that this hypothesis awaits experimental validation, which could involve FISH or chromosome conformation capture (3C) before and after inducing a predicted co-localizing event (e.g., testosterone exposure in prostate epithelial cells). Our findings align with the observation that ERG-overexpressing cancer cells accumulate DNA damage and are sensitive to poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibition (Brenner et al., 2011). Chromoplexy is active prior to ETS gene fusions, however, and generated ERG fusions in many instances.  Whole genome analysis also clarified the chronology of oncogenic events in prostate cancer progression, driven in part by chromoplexy. Genome-wide sequence coverage of germline SNPs allowed us to identify DNA lesions that arose after the founder clone was established. Subsequently, we demonstrated a progression of events within primary tumors that expands upon array-based SCNA co-occurrence studies (Demichelis et al., 2009). A consensus path of tumor evolution begins with events such as loss of NKX3-1 or fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG. The path proceeds with the loss of CDKN1B, TP53, PTEN, and other progression-associated lesions. We found that the histological grade of cancer may partially reflect its progression down this path.  A Continuum Model for Tumor Evolution  Tumorigenesis is classically understood to progress by a gradual accumulation of oncogenic alterations in the genome of a pre-cancerous cell. This textbook view was recently challenged by the discovery of chromothripsis, in which catastrophic rearrangements are incurred by \\u201cshattering\\u201d and reassembly of focal regions of the genome (Forment et al., 2012; Rausch et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2011).  We propose an expanded model for the evolution of prostate cancer, which may also apply to other cancers (Figure 7). As classically understood, passenger and driver alterations can accumulate in a cancer genome gradually over numerous cell divisions, via point mutations, simple translocations and focal copy-number alterations. On the opposite end of the spectrum, extreme instances of chromothripsis can induce massive (albeit relatively localized) DNA damage at once, often with oncogenic consequences (Rausch et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2011). Between these two extremes lies a broad continuum across which chromoplexy may often restructure cancer genomes. We propose that oncogenic events along this continuum reflect \\u201cpunctuated\\u201d tumor evolution, drawing an analogy from the observation that \\u201cpunctuated\\u201d evolution of species may occur rapidly between periods of relative mutational equilibrium (Gould, 1977). By analogy, a tumor genome may sustain considerable damage over several sequential and punctuated events. Importantly, this framework accords with the observation that chromoplexy events (1) are common, (2) may involve a wide-ranging number of rearrangements, and (3) may continue after cancer-initiating lesions such as NKX3-1 deletion (Figure S7).  Figure 7 Figure 7 A Continuum Model for the Genomic Evolution of Prostate Cancer A cancer might operate at any point along the continuum of progression at a given time. Tumors that develop primarily at the \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d end may require fewer events and could progress more quickly, because each such event could disrupt multiple cancer-constraining processes. At the same time, catastrophic events that cover diffuse genomic territory are more liable to disrupt essential or beneficial genes, thus imparting a selective disadvantage to (pre)malignant clones that sustain such events. Consequently, the model predicts that survivable chromoplexy (particularly near the catastrophic regime) is likely to involve oncogenic alterations that compensate for the incidental inactivation of essential genes (Figure 7, bottom). This prediction accords with the observation that most tumors show disruption of one or more putative prostate cancer genes within a chain. Moreover, this model raises the possibility that disruption of putative cancer genes by chromoplexy may heighten the probability that such genes represent \\u201cdriver\\u201d events for that particular tumor. If so, this framework may portend important implications for the use of whole-genome sequencing in diagnostic and clinical studies.  In summary, this study highlights the potential for WGS data to capture aspects of the \\u201cmolecular archeology\\u201d of cancer development that are missed by gene- or exome-level sequencing. The characterization of clonal progression and chromoplexy in emerging large panels of cancer genomes may provide insights about cancer initiation and progression, with implications for cancer detection, prevention and therapy.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample Acquisition  Prostate tumors were obtained under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols from consented patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or excision of soft-tissue metastases (PR-4240 and PR-7520). Normal DNA derived either from histologically benign prostate tissue or peripheral blood cells. Specimens were collected at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) by A.T. and at various medical centers in Western Australia in conjunction with Uropath Pty LTD (Perth, Australia).  DNA Library Construction and WGS  Tissue cores were extracted from cancerous foci of frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor nodules. After tissue homogenization and lysis, DNA was extracted and assessed for quality (Berger et al., 2011). Following library construction, paired-end sequencing reads of 101 nucleotides were generated with an Illumina GAIIx instrument. Sequencing data were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) and processed by the Picard pipelines (http://picard.sourceforge.net).  Detection and Validation of Genomic Alterations  Somatic point mutations, small indels and rearrangements were detected by comparison of tumor and paired normal genome sequences using MuTect (Cibulskis et al. 2013) and Indelocator Sivachenko et al., in preparation) (www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/) and dRanger (Berger et al., 2011), respectively. dRanger was used as described previously, (Berger et al., 2011), except that high-confidence rearrangements required support from four or more high-quality sequencing reads and were filtered against a panel of 176 normal tissue genomes. Somatic fusion breakpoints were located at basepair resolution where possible with the BreakPointer algorithm (Drier et al., 2013). Paired-end reads from rearrangements affecting cancer genes or participating in long chains were inspected manually. A subset of rearrangements was validated by resequencing and/or PCR amplification of tumor and normal DNA.  Chromosomal Copy Number Profiling  Segmented copy number profiles were generated from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 human SNP microarray (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) data as described previously (Barbieri et al., 2012). Sites of significant recurrent copy number alterations were identified by GISTICv2 (Mermel et al. 2011), with a log2 threshold of +/\\u2212 0.1 for amplification/deletion signals.  Identification of Chained Rearrangements and Deletions  The ChainFinder algorithm was implemented to detect chromoplexy from the combined analysis of somatic fusion breakpoints and segmented copy number profiles. ChainFinder considers breakpoints as nodes in a graph that are connected by edges corresponding to (a) fusions, (b) deletion bridges or (c) breakpoint adjacency that deviates significantly from the null model of independent breakpoints (Figure S3). Over several steps, the algorithm evaluates potential deletion bridges and adjacently mapping breakpoints to assign rearrangements to chains.  First, ChainFinder identifies potential deletion bridges by searching for distinct breakpoints that plausibly correspond to the boundaries of deletion events observed in copy number profiles. Next, a statistical analysis of all nearest-neighbor breakpoint pair distances identifies chain-like distributions of rearrangements. The local rate of expected independent breaks per nucleotide (\\u03bc) is calculated for 1Mb genomic windows based on (1) the rearrangement frequency within the window across a panel of tumor genomes and (2) the total number of breaks in the genome under consideration. Given \\u03bc, ChainFinder models the probability PXY of observing two independently arising fusion breakpoints within the observed distance L of each other on the reference genome (i.e., the p-value under the null model of independent breaks):  PXY=1\\u2212(1\\u22122\\u03bc)L If PXY is rejected with a false-discovery rate of 10\\u22122 (Benjamini, 1995), the corresponding breakpoints are linked in a chain.  The graph is also searched for closed paths (cycles) through nodes and connecting edges. For each cycle, all possible scenarios are considered by which the contained breakpoints could have arisen independently. Breakpoints in the cycle are assigned to the same chain if p values for every scenario can be rejected with a family-wise error rate (FWER) below 10\\u22122.  Lastly, the graph is finalized by assigning additional sets of edges corresponding to deletion bridges that could not be assigned uniquely in the first step. The search maximizes the number of deletion bridges in cycles to find solutions that account most fully for the overlap of fusion breakpoints with boundaries of deletion segments on the reference genome. A complete description of ChainFinder is provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. ChainFinder can be downloaded at www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/chainfinder.  Assessment of Stromal DNA Admixture and Clonality  We used the sequence coverage from germline SNPs at sites of somatic deletion to assess levels of stromal DNA admixture in sequenced samples and to infer the clonal status of mutations and deletions by applying CLONET (CLONality Estimate in Tumors; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We assessed the allelic fractions of SNP reads within hemizygously-deleted DNA to determine the apparent proportions of DNA from normal cells at the deleted locus. Deletions with the lowest apparent proportions of normal DNA reads were considered clonal. For all other deletions, we estimated the percentage of tumor cells harboring the deletion to infer the clonality of the lesion using simulation-based error estimates. For point mutations, the tumor allelic fraction was corrected for stromal DNA admixture and subclonality was inferred when the corrected fraction differed significantly from the expected value. Lesions present in 80% of cancer cells or less were considered subclonal.  Breast cancers can be divided into subtypes with important implications for prognosis and treatment. We set out to characterize the genetic alterations observed in different breast cancer subtypes and to identify specific candidate genes and pathways associated with subtype biology. mRNA expression levels of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 were shown to predict marker status determined by immunohistochemistry and to be effective at assigning samples to subtypes. HER2+ cancers were shown to have the greatest frequency of high-level amplification (independent of the ERBB2 amplicon itself), but triple-negative cancers had the highest overall frequencies of copy gain. Triple-negative cancers also were shown to have more frequent loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue and mutation of RB1, which may contribute to genomic instability. We identified and validated seven regions of copy number alteration associated with different subtypes, and used integrative bioinformatics analysis to identify candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including ERBB2, GRB7, MYST2, PPM1D, CCND1, HDAC2, FOXA1, and RASA1. We tested the candidate oncogene MYST2 and showed that it enhances the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. The genome-wide and region-specific differences between subtypes suggest the differential activation of oncogenic pathways. (Mol Cancer Res 2009;7(4):511\\u201322)  Introduction  Identification of the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that contribute to cancer development can lead to new therapeutic targets and strategies. Technological advances are beginning to enable researchers to profile cancers comprehensively for these abnormalities and to elucidate their functional significance. At the same time, there is an increasing understanding of the importance of cancer subtypes for prognosis and treatment. Cancer subtypes are distinct forms of a disease that have different origins, molecular characteristics, or clinical features. They often also respond differently to therapy, so higher-resolution definitions of subtypes and improved understanding of their biological differences are important for improving cancer treatment.  Breast cancer has relatively well-established and studied subtypes. Newly diagnosed cancers are routinely assessed for the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) and for overexpression or amplification of the ERBB2 gene (encoding the HER2 protein). In general, patients with ERBB2/HER2\\u2013positive (HER2+) tumors are candidates for treatment with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (1). Patients with ER- or PR-positive tumors are candidates for treatment with hormonal therapy, including selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen for premenopausal women or aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women (2-4). Patients whose tumors are neither HER2+ nor ER+/PR+ (so-called triple-negative tumors) currently have no targeted therapy available and have relatively poor prognosis (5-7).  In recent years, the application of molecular profiling technologies, in particular DNA microarrays for measuring mRNA expression, has added to our knowledge of breast cancer subtypes. Hierarchical clustering with gene expression data has been shown to organize tumor samples into groups with distinct gene expression patterns and significantly different clinical outcomes (8-10). The three major subgroups defined by gene expression profiling are similar to those defined in clinical practice: a HER2+ group, a luminal group (which is predominantly ER+/PR+), and a basal-like group (which predominantly lacks HER2 overexpression, ER, and PR). The terminal duct-lobular unit of the breast, the structure from which the majority of breast cancers arise, is composed of two types of epithelial cells. The inner or luminal cells are potential milk-secreting cells and are surrounded by an outer basal layer of contractile myoepithelial cells. Basal-like breast tumors are so called because they express genes, such as cytokeratins 5, 6, and 17, that are typically expressed in normal myoepithelial cells, whereas luminal tumors are characterized by expression of more epithelial-like genes such as E-cadherin and cytokeratins 8 and 18 (7-13). Clustering also suggests higher-resolution subtypes with biologically interesting features. For example, several studies have reported subdivisions of the luminal type dubbed luminal A and luminal B (the latter has lower levels of ER transcripts and less favorable clinical outcomes). The presence of other subtypes varies more from study to study, presumably due to methodologic differences, variation between sample sets, and the instability of hierarchical clustering results. A statistically stringent meta-analysis of data from multiple gene expression studies identified three robust subtypes that closely resemble the HER2+, ER+/PR+, and triple-negative types defined in clinical practice (14).  In this study, we explore the hypothesis that breast cancers of different subtypes are both characterized and caused by different sets of genetic lesions. Beyond the associations of HER2 and hormone receptor status with the HER2+ and luminal subtypes, there are indications that distinct oncogenic alterations and pathways are associated with different breast cancer subtypes. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss are most common in basal-like cancers (6, 7, 15-19). Amplification of CCND1 and activating mutation of PIK3CA are associated with ER and PR positivity (17, 20). In addition, the availability of genome-wide copy number profiling has made it possible to identify region-specific copy number alterations associated with clinical characteristics such as hormone receptor status, gene mutation status, disease subtype, and clinical outcome (21-25). We use high-resolution genome-wide copy number profiling and cancer gene resequencing to identify copy number alterations and somatic mutations that are associated with breast cancer subtypes in both tumors and cancer cell lines. We also characterize subtype differences in overall levels of genome alteration. We use bioinformatics methods to prioritize candidate causative genes in subtype-associated regions of copy number gain, and show that these methods can help to identify oncogenes. Finally, we relate our results to distinct patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in different subtypes.  Results  ER, PR, and HER2 mRNA Expression Levels Predict Breast Cancer Subtypes  We characterized genetic alterations in 51 breast tumors and 46 breast cancer cell lines. We set out to study the three major subtypes defined by current clinical practice: Samples with amplified or overexpressed HER2 were assigned to the HER2+ subtype; HER2 negative samples expressing ER or PR were assigned to the ER+/PR+ subtype; and other samples were assigned to the triple-negative subtype. These subtypes are determined using a simple algorithm with a clear biological basis, and their relevance to prognosis and treatment is well established.  ER, PR, and HER2 status is generally determined in clinical practice by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization, but results from these approaches were available for only a fraction of the tumor samples in this study (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S1). We therefore developed logistic regression classifiers for ER and PR status using microarray data for the ESR1 and PGR genes. The microarray data for these genes predicted pathologist-determined marker status very well (Supplementary Fig. S1) with error rates in the training data set of 12 of 143 for ER and 32 of 142 for PR. To infer HER2 status, we identified samples with copy gains at the ERBB2 locus or mRNA overexpression (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1). These procedures were used to assign 51 breast tumors to three subtypes (8 HER2+, 26 ER+/PR+, 17 triple negative). Assigning the tumors to the five main subtypes defined by gene expression data (26) gave similar results (Supplementary Table S1). None of our samples were assigned to the normal-like gene expression subtype and only one was assigned to the luminal B subtype. Our sample set is therefore insufficient to investigate these additional subtypes.  Application of the mRNA- and copy number\\u2013based classifiers to breast cancer cell lines assigned 15 lines as HER2+, 12 as ER+/PR+, and 19 as triple negative. Our assignments are in good agreement with the recent study of Neve et al. (27), which classified all of our triple-negative cell lines as basal-like and all but one of our ER+/PR+ cell lines as luminal. The results from both breast tumors and cell lines indicated that the expression levels of ESR1 and PGR are good surrogates for ER and PR status.  HER2+ and Triple-Negative Breast Tumors Exhibit Higher Copy Number Instability  To understand whether overall genomic instability differs between breast cancer subtypes, we first examined the overall frequencies of copy number alterations in tumors (Fig. 1A). The fractions of the genome exhibiting copy gains differ significantly between the subtypes (P < 0.05, when any threshold for copy number gain \\u22652.8 copies is considered). Triple-negative tumors have the highest frequencies of modest gains. However, HER2+ tumors have the highest frequencies of high-level gains, which include focal amplifications. This trend is not explained simply by the ERBB2 amplicon on chromosome 17 because the same differences between the subtypes are observed when chromosome 17 is excluded from consideration (Fig. 1B). The same subtype differences were observed in cell lines (data not shown). We did not find a statistically significant difference in frequencies of copy number loss between the subtypes.  FIGURE 1.

The mean fraction of the genome exhibiting gains, including and excluding chromosome 17, respectively, as different thresholds for copy gain are considered in triple-negative (red), HER2+ (green), and ER+/PR+ (blue) samples. C. Box plot of the chromosomal instability signature (CIN25) by subtype. Carter et al. (28) estimated the aneuploidy of individual cancer samples by quantifying the extent to which genes in the same chromosomal region have coordinated mRNA expression levels. The CIN25 signature is made up of genes whose expression is correlated with this measure of aneuploidy. High CIN25 values are associated with poor outcome in several tumor types. To further characterize the differences in genomic instability among the tumor subtypes, we used a gene expression signature that reflects chromosomal instability and is associated with poor outcome in several cancer types (28). We tested whether the signature is the same in all three subtypes. We found that triple-negative and HER2+ tumors have higher expression of the instability signature than ER+/PR+ tumors (P = 0.005; Fig. 1C). This is consistent with the subtype differences in frequencies of copy number gains and also with the worse prognosis associated with HER2+ and triple-negative cancers (8-10).  Copy Number Changes Associated with Breast Cancer Subtypes  In addition to global patterns of copy number alteration, we set out to identify specific regions of copy number alteration associated with subtypes and the functionally important genes within those regions. Figure 2 shows the frequencies of gains and losses for the different subtypes as measured in tumors with Affymetrix 500k single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We observed some differences in frequencies between subtypes similar to those described in recent studies (e.g., losses on 5q in triple negative, gains on 10p in triple negative and HER2+, gains on 11q13 in ER+/PR+; refs. 22-24). We also observed some additional differences (e.g., losses on 6q in ER+/PR+, gains on 17q21 and 17q23 in ER+/PR+ and HER2+, losses on 15p in triple negative).  FIGURE 2.

Graphs show gains above the x axis (frequency times magnitude) and losses below the x axis (frequency) in triple negative (A), HER2+ (B), and ER+/PR+ (C) subtypes. Arrows, regions of subtype-associated gains; asterisks, regions of subtype-associated losses. These regions were selected based on the tumor data only, without regard to replication in cell lines. Different frequencies of copy number alteration within a region may occur by chance and may be characteristic of one sample set but not observed in others. We sought to identify regions that were both statistically significantly associated with subtypes and observed in two independent sample sets. We first identified chromosomal regions with recurrent gains or losses (>2.5 copies or <1.6 copies in at least 10% of tumor samples) with differences in gain or loss frequency between subtypes in tumors. We then validated these regions in data from an independent set of 47 breast cancer cell lines. A total of seven chromosomal regions showed consistent association in both sample sets (Table 1; Fig. 3).  View inlineView popup Table 1.

Copy number in regions associated with subtype. Blue, losses; red, gains. The genomic intervals consistently associated with subtype in both tumors and cell lines were identified. The physically adjacent intervals with the same pattern of subtype association were merged together to form the seven regions shown. The average copy number of the merged intervals is indicated by color: blue, losses; red, gains. Candidate Driver Genes for Subtype-Associated Regions  A recurrent region of copy number alteration typically extends over multiple genes. Identifying the driver genes (genes functionally involved in tumorigenesis) with confidence generally requires extensive experimentation. We therefore developed a computational strategy to identify candidate driver genes for experimental follow-up based on three hypotheses: first, that driver genes are found in the part of a region of recurrent copy number alteration that is most frequently and most significantly gained or lost; second, that driver genes undergo marked alterations in gene expression as a consequence of copy number change; and third, that changes in expression of driver genes may be associated with poor clinical outcome. Not all of these three hypotheses may hold for every driver gene, but combining the evidence from the three can identify candidates.  In the HER2 amplicon, for example, ERBB2 is found at the most amplified point, is overexpressed on amplification, and is associated with increased occurrence of distant metastasis in the study of van't Veer et al. (ref. 29; Fig. 4A). One other gene in the amplicon, GRB7, also meets these criteria. This may simply be because of its proximity to ERBB2, but RNA interference studies suggest that GRB7 may also contribute to proliferation of breast cancer cells (30).  FIGURE 4.

Chromosome 11 70 Mb region. Top, summarized copy gain (red) and the locations of genes associated with distant metastasis at P < 0.05 (blue). Dotted lines define the focal region within which copy number was associated with subtype and within which driver genes were sought. Bottom, \\u2212log10 transformed P values reflecting increased gene expression on amplification. Genes passing the P value threshold (0.05) are labeled. Applying the same procedure to other regions of copy gain identifies other candidate oncogenes. In the amplicon around 45 Mbp on chromosome 17q21 (Fig. 4B), which is associated with the ER+/PR+ and HER2+ subtypes, there is a single gene that fulfills all three criteria: MYST2, which encodes a histone acetyltransferase (HBO1) that has been implicated in the regulation of DNA synthesis and in steroid hormone receptor signaling (31-34). In the amplicon around 55 Mbp (17q23), PPM1D is the only gene meeting all three criteria, although it is not strongly supported by any individual line of evidence. The genes TMEM49 and RPS6KB1 (encoding p70 ribosomal S6 kinase) are also located under the peak of this amplification, and their expression levels are strongly associated with copy number alteration in the region (Fig. 4C). The peak of amplification around 70 Mbp on chromosome 11q13, also associated with ER+/PR+ and HER2+ subtypes, contains no genes associated with recurrence (Fig. 4D). Driver gene status is often attributed to CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1), which has significantly increased expression in amplified samples, along with the neighboring genes ORAOV1, FADD, and PPFIA1. In the region around 35 Mbp on chromosome 14q13, which is associated with the ER+/PR+ subtype, only FOXA1 has elevated expression in tumors with increased copy number (Supplementary Fig. S2A).  For regions of deletion/loss, the amplitude or the frequency of the alteration does not provide as much information as in regions of copy gain because there are at most two chromosomes to be lost and deletions are usually broad. The identification of candidates therefore relies primarily on the association of gene expression with copy number loss and clinical outcome (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). Both these lines of evidence support the candidates ARHGAP18, HDAC2, and NCOA7 in deletions around 116 Mbp on chromosome 6q (associated with the ER+/PR+ subtype). The deletion located around 80 Mb on chromosome 5q13-14 (associated with HER2+ and triple-negative subtypes) contains a single gene supported by two lines of evidence: RASA1, which encodes the RAS GTPase activating protein p120GAP.  MYST2 Drives the Growth of Breast Cancer Cells  We selected the candidate driver gene MYST2 (also known as HBO1) for further study because it has particularly strong supporting evidence in our analysis. MYST2 is required for growth in 293T cells (31) but is not an established oncogene. Overexpression of MYST2 (Supplementary Fig. S4) dramatically enhanced the anchorage-independent growth of both MCF7 (Fig. 5A and B) and SKBR3 breast cancer cells (Fig. 5C and D). Previous studies in MCF7 cells, which have a modest copy number gain in this region, have also shown that siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYST2 substantially impairs cell proliferation and blocks progression through the S phase of the cell cycle compared with control siRNA treatment (31). Taken together, the observations that MYST2 knockdown blocks proliferation and that MYST2 overexpression can shift cell lines to a more transformed state support the hypothesis that it is the oncogene driving amplification around 45 Mbp on chromosome 17.

Association of PTEN Loss and Somatic Mutations with Breast Cancer Subtypes  We sequenced a panel of genes with well-characterized cancer-causing mutations in the cell line collection, and we evaluated both the mutations we found and published mutation data for association with breast cancer subtypes (Table 2). We observed the following overall mutation frequencies: 73% (TP53), 34% (PIK3CA), 11%(RB1), 9% (PTEN), 7% (CDKN2A), 5% (BRAF), 2% (KRAS), and 2% (HRAS). These are generally very similar to those reported in the COSMIC database (35). TP53, however, has a lower mutation rate in COSMIC (54%), so our cell line collection may have different characteristics from the 80 breast carcinoma samples that currently have data in COSMIC. We did not see evidence that mutations in TP53, PTEN, or CDKN2A are associated with specific breast cancer subtypes. PIK3CA mutations were enriched in the ER+/PR+ and HER2+ subtypes, which is consistent with previous reports (17), although this enrichment was not statistically significant.  View inlineView popup Table 2. Amino Acid Mutations and PTEN Protein Loss in Breast Cancer Cell Lines All four mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and HRAS were in triple-negative samples. This suggests an association between mutations in the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal\\u2013regulated kinase pathway and the triple-negative subtype (P = 0.05). An additional triple-negative cell line (CAL-51) has also been reported to harbor an activating oncogenic mutation in a RAS family member (36, 37).  Loss of PTEN has previously been reported to be associated with ER and PR negative status (15, 17, 38). Mutation and deletion at the PTEN locus are imperfect surrogates for loss of PTEN protein (15, 27), so we evaluated the association between PTEN and subtypes in cell lines by Western blot. We observed PTEN loss in 59% (10 of 17) of triple-negative samples but only in 17% (2 of 12) of ER+/PR+ samples and 8% (1 of 13) of HER2+ samples (P = 0.002). The chromosomal instability signature was higher in samples with PTEN loss than in those without, although this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05; data not shown).  All four mutations in RB1 were found in triple-negative samples, and we found that loss of retinoblastoma protein (RB) function is associated with the triple-negative subtype (P = 0.006). The inactivation of RB was further examined in the 51 breast tumor samples using a 59-gene expression signature reflecting RB dysregulation (39, 40). This signature was significantly higher in the triple-negative subtype than in HER2+ and ER+/PR+ subtypes (P = 0.002, Fig. 6). In addition, the chromosomal instability signature was higher in samples with RB1 mutation than in those without (P = 0.01; data not shown).  FIGURE 6.

The RB signature score, reflecting pathway dysregulation, is summarized in a box plot by subtype. Discussion  In this study, we have characterized genetic alterations associated with the three major and most reproducible breast cancer subtypes, defined by tumor ER, PR, and HER2 status. The widespread adoption of consistent and robust analysis methods and larger sample sets should make it possible to carry out a similar analysis of higher-resolution subtypes such as luminal A and luminal B.  In clinical practice, ER and PR status is generally established by immunohistochemistry, and HER2 status by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found that levels of ESR1 and PGR mRNAs, even when measured by microarray, can accurately predict immunohistochemistry status and be used in determining subtype. Similar conclusions were reached for HER2 and ER in a recent study (41), although the authors did not examine PR.  In this study, we used both tumor and cell line samples. Analysis of copy number was carried out primarily in tumors, with cell lines used for confirmation. Point mutations were studied in cell lines. The copy number alterations observed in cell lines have been shown to be very similar to those observed in tumors (27), but the differences that do exist have implications for our study. To select copy number alterations that are reproducibly and robustly associated with breast cancer subtypes, we required that regions discovered in tumors also be associated with subtypes in cell lines. This protects us from finding alterations induced by cell culture, but it almost certainly contributed to our false negative rate. Some of the most significant findings in tumors were not reproduced in cell lines, for example, the association of gains around 7 Mbp on 10p14-15.1 in the triple-negative and HER2+ subtypes. This may be due in part to some copy number alterations being selected against in vitro and in part to lack of statistical power. Another caveat is that cell lines believed to represent breast cancer may actually be derived from other cancers, as in the case of MDA-MB-435, which represents melanoma (42, 43) and which was not used in this study. We note that the mutations in BRAF and APC (44) observed in DU4475 are more typical of colorectal than breast cancer, and the gene expression profile of this line is not very similar to other cancers of either the large intestine or breast (data not shown).  In the seven regions of copy number alteration that we found to be reproducibly associated with subtype, we used three bioinformatics-based criteria to prioritize candidate driver genes. Such approaches can only generate hypotheses requiring further studies, but the results on regions with known driver genes are encouraging. First, we assumed that the driver gene would be found in the most recurrently and profoundly altered location in a region of alteration. It may be that local features such as repeat sequences or chromatin structure bias the exact boundaries of these regions. However, our data and other studies suggest that these boundaries vary widely between individual tumors (45-49) so that, over an adequate number of samples, the location with most copy number alteration can be used to pinpoint candidate driver genes. Our second assumption, that the expression of a driver gene should be significantly affected by copy number, is limited primarily by the finding that alterations in copy number affect the expression of a significant fraction of genes. The final assumption that the expression of a driver gene should be associated with variation in clinical outcome may be more useful for identifying very strong candidates than for excluding genes from consideration. The driver gene by definition is (or has been) beneficial to the tumor, but this benefit may not always translate into outcome, particularly because outcome may be evaluated in different ways. However, when alteration in gene expression is found to be associated with poor outcome, this provides additional reason to prioritize a gene for follow-up.  Further studies may also be informed by other features of the candidate driver genes and regions we identified. Several candidates have links to steroid hormone receptor signaling, which may contribute to the association of some regions of gain with the ER+/PR+ subtype. However, this does not offer a complete explanation because these gains are sometimes observed in ER- and PR-negative cancers. FOXA1 is the only gene significantly up-regulated upon the amplification on 14q20 associated with the ER+/PR+ subtype. It encodes a forkhead transcription factor, which is required for ER-mediated transcriptional activation of many transcriptional targets (50, 51). Within the amplicon on 17q23 (associated with ER+/PR+ and HER2+ cancers) there are several genes that have evidence of oncogenic activity (52-55). The only gene to meet all three criteria in our prioritization is PPM1D. PPM1D activity has been shown to not only lead to inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53 but also to stimulate ER and PR activity (53), again suggesting a relationship with hormone receptor\\u2013dependent cancers. However, the 17q23 amplification also includes other candidate protein-coding oncogenes and mir-21, a microRNA gene with oncogenic properties known to be up-regulated in breast cancer (56-58). MYST2, the only gene in the amplicon on 17q21 to meet all three selection criteria, encodes the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase implicated in the regulation of DNA synthesis (31, 34, 59, 60). HBO1 has also been shown to enhance transcription mediated by steroid receptors including ER and PR (32, 33, 61). Our finding that overexpression of MYST2 enhances colony formation in soft agar by SKBR3 cells, which are HER2+, suggests that MYST2 is a bona fide oncogene that acts independently of ER and PR. Further studies are required to confirm and elucidate the relationship between MYST2 and oncogenesis.  Another candidate driver gene that fits into an emerging pattern of subtype-specific pathway activation is RASA1, which encodes the RAS GTPase activating protein p120GAP. Somatic mutations in RASA1 have been observed in basal cell carcinoma (62) and the gene is located in a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in BRCA1 mutant breast cancers (63), which have gene expression profiles similar to those of triple-negative cancers. RASA1 is the only gene meeting all three selection criteria in the region of loss on 5q13 associated with the triple-negative and HER2+ subtypes. p120GAP activates the intrinsic GTPase activity of wild-type RAS, shifting it into its inactive GDP-bound form. Triple-negative cancers also harbor all the KRAS and BRAF activating mutations we observed and have been reported by others to be characterized by activation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (6, 7, 18, 19). These several lines of evidence are consistent with triple-negative cancers being more frequently dependent on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, suggesting they may be more susceptible to therapeutic intervention targeting this pathway.  Another interesting feature of triple-negative cancers that may have therapeutic implications is their increased genomic instability, as evidenced by frequent copy gains and the chromosomal instability expression signature. We cannot exclude the possibility that the differences we observed in genome instability between the subtypes are due to the representation of different stages of development within our tumor samples. However, we observed similar differences in instability between subtypes in cell lines. Triple-negative cancers also have more frequent alterations affecting PTEN and RB1, both of which are involved in maintaining genome integrity (64-66). Defects in cell cycle checkpoints may make triple-negative breast cancers more sensitive to cytotoxic therapy (67), particularly DNA damaging agents (39), and to other therapies that exploit defects in DNA repair (68).  Continuing advances in molecular profiling technologies are making it possible to identify the genetic and epigenetic alterations characteristic of cancer subtypes. Through integrative analysis of different data types, we can relate these alterations to the activity of oncogenic pathways and to therapeutic opportunities.  Materials and Methods  Breast Samples  Fresh frozen breast tumors with >70% tumor content were obtained from 51 patients by Gene Logic, Inc. Tumor samples were acquired from several centers and were accompanied by varying amounts of clinical data. Fixed material was not available to the authors of this study to directly evaluate HER2, ER, or PR status. The cell lines AU565, BT-474, BT-483, BT-549, CAMA-1, DU4475, HCC1143, HCC1395, HCC1419, HCC1428, HCC1500, HCC1569, HCC1806, HCC1954, HCC202, HCC2218, HCC38, HCC70, Hs578T, KPL-1, MCF7, MDA-MB-175VII, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-415, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3, SW527, T-47D, UACC-812, UACC-893, ZR-75-1, and ZR-75-30 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines CAL-120, CAL-148, CAL-51, CAL-85-1, EFM-19, EFM-192A, EVSA-T, HCC1937, HDQ-P1, JIMT-1, and MFM-223 were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 2 mmol/L l-glutamine. Cell line copy number analysis (69) was carried out on genomic DNA extracted from subconfluent cell cultures using Qiagen DNAeasy kits.  Microarray Profiling  All microarrays were purchased from Affymetrix. Gene expression data were generated for all 51 tumor and 46 cell line samples with HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays according to the manufacturer's protocols and processed using Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Where multiple probe sets were available for a gene, the probe set with the highest mean intensity was used. Tumor DNA was run on Mapping 500k SNP arrays and cell line DNA was run on Mapping 100k SNP arrays according to the manufacturer's protocols. Signal intensities were extracted using dChip 2005 (70), median centered, converted to log 2 ratios, and segmented using the GLAD R package (71). Copy numbers were calculated as 2(inferred log 2 ratio + 1). Other analyses were carried out in R5 and Spotfire (TIBCO). Microarray data are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus repository under accession nos. GSE7545, GSE12777, and GSE13696.  Breast Cancer Subtype Assignment  ER and PR classifiers were developed using gene expression data from 143 tumors (ER) and 142 tumors (PR), which had immunohistochemistry status supplied by Gene Logic. Samples for which any level of positivity was recorded were considered positive. The probe set with the smallest residual variance was selected for each gene (ER: 205225_at, PR: 208305_at) and used to train a univariate logistic regression model. For HER2, our intent was to mimic the criteria used to direct trastuzumab therapy, but the HER2 status information available from Gene Logic was not detailed enough. We assigned the HER2-positive status to samples with ERBB2 mRNA expression (probe set 216836_s_at) or copy number (by SNP array) at least 2 SD above the mean (Supplementary Fig. S1). These classifiers were used to determine subtype for 10 cell lines and all 51 breast tumors. HER2-positive samples were assigned to the HER2 subtype; HER2-negative samples that were positive for ER or PR were assigned to the ER+/PR+ subtype; and HER2-, ER-, and PR-negative samples were assigned to the triple-negative subtype. Subtype assignment with 370 \\u201cintrinsic\\u201d genes (10) mapped to the Affymetrix microarray was by hierarchical clustering with Pearson correlation. Samples were also assigned to the higher-resolution subtype (26) for which the gene expression centroid had the highest Spearman correlation.  Analysis of Genome-Wide Copy Number Alterations  The May 2004 human genome release (72) was divided into nonoverlapping 100kb segments. The representative copy number for each of 27,820 segments with at least one SNP was calculated by taking the median GLAD-segmented copy number for the SNPs found therein. The fraction of segments with gains or losses was then counted for a range of gain or loss thresholds. Similar results were observed when the entire genome was divided into 862 cytobands according to the boundaries available in release hg17 of the UCSC genome browser (ref. 73; data not shown). Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the association between gain or loss frequency and subtype.  Gene Expression Signatures  Chromosomal instability (CIN25) and RB signatures were calculated as the mean MAS5 expression level for the relevant genes (28, 40) and scaled to have a mean value of 1. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate subtype differences.  Association between Copy Number and Subtypes  The unique set of copy number segment boundaries from all tumor samples was used to define the boundaries of 4,556 genomic intervals. The segmented copy number value within each interval is constant in each tumor sample. For further analysis, 2,714 intervals including at least three SNPs and with absolute log 2 copy number ratio >0.3 in at least five tumors were selected. Association between the copy number alteration in each interval and subtype was evaluated by two-sample t test. False discovery rates were estimated using the q value procedure (74). Intervals with q values <7% were tested by the same analysis procedure in 47 breast cancer cell lines, and the intervals showing consistent association (P < 0.05) were selected.  Identification of Candidate Driver Genes  The regions of most notable copy number gain were identified by multiplying mean gain amplitude by gain frequency (75). Expression levels in samples with and without copy number alteration were compared by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. A log 2 copy number ratio <\\u22120.3 was used to identify samples with losses and a ratio >0.3 was used to identify samples with gains. Association between expression and clinical outcome (time to distant metastasis) was evaluated using the data of van't Veer et al. (29). Their microarray probes were assigned to genes by mapping to the genome with BLAT (76) and finding overlaps with alignments of RefSeq mRNA sequences from UCSC (ref. 73; hg17 release). Within each region the relationship between expression level and time to distant metastasis was estimated by a Cox proportional hazards model and the significance level was calculated by a likelihood ratio test. P value thresholds of 0.05 were used without adjustments for multiple testing. The results of this analysis are limited to prioritizing candidates for follow-up and do not provide statistical evidence that any individual gene is a driver.  Somatic Mutation Data in Breast Cell Lines  Exonic regions were amplified by PCR of genomic DNA and sequenced in both directions using Big Dye Terminator Kit reagents and ABI PRISM 3730xl sequencing machines (Applied Biosystems). Sequence variants were identified using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics) and confirmed by manual trace review and a second round of sequencing. Matched nontumor samples were not available to confirm that the variants are somatic. Oncogenes tend to be subject to a relatively small number of recurrent activating mutations, and for these genes we only analyzed mutations that have been shown to be somatic in other studies (35). For tumor suppressors, a much wider variety of mutations can impair function, so we considered all variants that do not correspond to any record in dbSNP (77) and that change the amino acid sequence. It is possible that a few of these variants represent novel polymorphisms or functionally insignificant mutations. However, the vast majority correspond to known somatic mutations (35), and most of the rest introduce frameshifts and are likely to result in protein inactivation. Associations between mutation status and subtype were evaluated by two-sided Fisher's exact test.  Western Blotting  Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis through NuPage Bis-Tris 4% to 12% gradient gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Criterion system from Bio-Rad. Specific antigen-antibody interaction was detected with a horseradish peroxidase\\u2013conjugated secondary antibody IgG using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-PTEN antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used with an anti\\u2013glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Abcam) as loading control. The anti-MYST2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used with an anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as loading control. Western blot images were scanned and MYST2 and actin bands were quantitated using Image J software.6  Transient Transfection and Colony Formation Assay  Cells were transfected with pCMV-XL5 expressing MYST2 (Origene) using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon). Seven thousand five hundred cells in growth medium containing 0.4% agarose were seeded in each well of a six-well plate on medium containing 0.8% agarose. Colonies were stained after 3 to 4 wk with 5 mmol/L Calcein AM (Invitrogen) and counted with the ImageXpress Micro system (Molecular Devices).  Local recurrence is the most serious complication of anterior resection for rectal cancer, usually occurring during the first two years after surgery. Over a five-year period, from 1981 to 1986, 183 patients underwent anterior resection for rectal carcinoma at the Surgery Ward of the University of Ferrara. Patients were followed for two years postoperatively. All operations were performed with staplers and classified according to Dukes, with 43 cases of Dukes' A; 83 cases of Dukes' B; and 57 cases of Dukes' C. In the first 24 months after surgery, the tumor recurred locally in 44 of the 183 patients (24 percent). Dukes' stage, grading distal resection margin, and histopathologic differentiation of the distal rectal ring left in the stapler after anastomosis were assessed to determine a prognostic indicator for the recurrence of the tumor. The stage:recurrence ratio was as follows: A, 1 (2 percent); B, 21 (25 percent); and C, 22 (39 percent). The grading:recurrence ratio was: G1, 13:51 (25 percent); G2, 24:110 (22 percent); and G3, 7:22 (32 percent). The ratio between distal rectal resection margin and recurrence was: 0 to 2 cm, 15:27 (56 percent); 2 to 4 cm, 16:74 (22 percent); and over 4 cm, 13:82 (15 percent). Histopathologic examination of the distal rectal ring was negative for all patients. These data confirm the direct relationship between class and local recurrence and indicate histologic grade and distal resection margin as significant prognostic parameters only when interpreted in the light of staging.  FoxA1 (FOXA1) is a pioneering transcription factor of the androgen receptor (AR) that is indispensible for the lineage-specific gene expression of the prostate. To date, there have been conflicting reports on the role of FoxA1 in prostate cancer progression and prognosis. With recent discoveries of recurrent FoxA1 mutations in human prostate tumors, comprehensive understanding of FoxA1 function has become very important. Here, through genomic analysis we reveal that FoxA1 regulates two distinct oncogenic processes via disparate mechanisms. FoxA1 induces cell growth requiring the AR pathway. On the other hand, FoxA1 inhibits cell motility and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through AR-independent mechanism directly opposing the action of AR signaling. Using orthotopic mouse models we further show that FoxA1 inhibits prostate tumor metastasis in vivo. Concordant with these contradictory effects on tumor progression, FoxA1 expression is slightly up-regulated in localized prostate cancer wherein cell proliferation is the main feature, but is remarkably down-regulated when the disease progresses to metastatic stage for which cell motility and EMT are essential. Importantly, recently identified FoxA1 mutants have drastically attenuated ability in suppressing cell motility. Taken together, our findings illustrate an AR-independent function of FoxA1 as a metastasis inhibitor and provide a mechanism by which recurrent FoxA1 mutations contribute to prostate cancer progression.  Go to: INTRODUCTION FoxA1 (FOXA1), also named HNF-3\\u03b1, is a winged-helix transcription factor of the forkhead family. It plays essential roles in the epithelial differentiation and development of a number of organs including the pancreas, prostate and breast (1\\u20136). For example, while FoxA1-knockout mice are developmentally lethal, conditional FoxA1 knockout in the mouse prostate results in severely altered ductal development that contains immature epithelial cells surrounded by abnormally thick stromal layers (7). Concordantly, in the adult prostate FoxA1 has also been tightly linked to the maintenance of the prostate epithelial phenotype and the expression of prostate-specific genes. This is mediated through its regulation of the Androgen Receptor (AR) transcriptional activities (8; 9). As a pioneering factor FoxA1 opens up compact chromatin to facilitate subsequent AR recruitment (4; 10\\u201313). Genome-wide location analysis of prostate cancer cells have shown that FoxA1 pre-occupies lineage-specific enhancers even before androgen stimulation and co-occupies a majority of AR binding sites in androgen-treated cells. FoxA1 is thus indispensible for defining a prostatic AR program and is critical to prostate development, function, as well as malignant transformation.  Consistent with its being a pro-differentiation factor, functionally FoxA1 has been shown to inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells (14). Low FoxA1 level has been associated with high grade, late-stage tumors in bladder cancer (15). Similarly, FoxA1 exhibits tumor suppressive functions in breast cancer and high FoxA1 expression is correlated with favorable prognosis in ER-positive breast tumors (16). However, reports of FoxA1 function in prostate cancer (PCa) have been controversial. FoxA1 level has been associated with either good or bad clinical outcomes depending on the patient cohort. For example, some studies have shown that high FoxA1 expression is associated with worse prognosis probably by enhancing AR activity (17; 18), while other studies have demonstrated an association of decreased FoxA1 expression with castration-resistant, poor prognosis prostate tumors (19). Concordantly, functional studies have shown that FoxA1 increases cell proliferation through regulation of cell cycle genes, which may be in part modulated via its control of AR-mediated transcriptional regulation. FoxA1 has also been implicated in the EMT of prostate cancer cells (18; 20; 21). Comprehensive analysis of FoxA1 function however has not been attempted and whether or not FoxA1 can regulate PCa independently of AR is unclear.  Genomic studies have recently revealed recurrent FoxA1 gene mutations in human prostate tumors (22; 23). Through next-generation sequencing, 4 of 111 exomes were found to harbor non-silencing mutations to the FoxA1 gene including the M253K mutation. Similarly, in another study 5 FoxA1 mutations including F400I mutation are found in 3.4% of human prostate tumors (both localized and metastatic PCa) (22). Most mutations cluster on the C-terminal transactivation domain of the FoxA1 gene, likely disrupting its binding to DNA and attenuating its transactivation of target genes (23). How these mutations contribute to PCa progression and what are the key downstream targets, however, are yet to be understood.  In the present study, through genomic analysis we found that FoxA1 regulates two distinct oncogenic processes through respective manipulation of genes involved in cell cycle and cell motility. Combining functional assays with gene expression microarrays we demonstrate that FoxA1 induces cell growth but inhibits cell motility through AR-dependent and \\u2013opposing mechanisms, respectively. We then pinpoint a key downstream molecule involved in its anti-motility function and demonstrate the relevance of this regulation in vivo and in human specimens. We further provide evidence that recurrent FoxA1 mutations found in patients have attenuated anti-motility ability.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient tissue specimens  Patient samples were requested from the Northwestern University Prostate Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) Tissue Core. All samples were collected with informed consent of the patients and prior Institutional Review Board approval. Prostate tissue was harvested according to standard operating procedures of the Prostate SPORE Tissue Bank as previously reported (24; 25). Briefly, tissue was snap frozen within 20\\u201330 min after surgical removal and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C.  Plasmids, siRNAs, and antibodies  Human FoxA1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from LNCaP cells and cloned into the entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen). The pCR8-FoxA1 F400I and M252K mutants were generated using QuikChange\\u00ae II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Adenoviral construct expressing FoxA1 was generated by recombining pCR8-FoxA1 with pAD/CMV/V5 using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen). Control pAD/CMV/LACZ clones were obtained from Invitrogen. Lentiviral constructs were generated by LR recombination between pCR8-FoxA1 constructs and pLenti CMV/TO Puro DEST (Addgene plasmid 17293). The pGIPZ lentiviral control, FoxA1 and SLUG shRNAmir were purchased from Open Biosystems. The pLenti-CMV-puro-Luc lentiviral luciferase construct (Addgene plasmid 17477) was used to monitor tumor growth in living mice. FoxA1 siRNA (sense 5\\u2032-GAGAGAAAAAAUCAACAGC-3\\u2032; antisense 5\\u2032-GCUGUUGAUUUUUUCUCUC-3\\u2032) (26) and control Luciferase GL2 Duplex siRNA (D-001100-01-20) were synthesized by Dharmacon. The antibodies used in this study include anti-E-Cad (MAB3199) from Millipore, anti-FoxA1 (ab23738) and anti-GAPDH-HRP (ab9385) from Abcam, anti-SLUG (9585s) and anti-Vimentin(3932p) from Cell Signaling, and anti-Vimentin (sc-2620) from Santa Cruz.  ChIP and ChIP-PCR analysis  ChIP was carried out as described previously (25; 30; 31). All primers (listed in Supplementary Table S7) were designed using Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/), synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, and utilized for SYBR Green based real-time PCR. ChIP-PCR enrichment of target loci was normalized to input DNA.  Gene expression array and data analysis  Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The integrity of the RNA was monitored using Bioanalyzer 2100. Microarray profiling was performed using HumanHT-12 v 4.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina). Bead-level data were preprocessed using GenomeStudio (Illumina), and the expression values were quantile-normalized using the beadarray package in Bioconductor. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a 2-fold cutoff. Gene Ontology (GO) terms enrichment was analyzed using GOrilla (http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/) (27).  Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assay  Cell proliferation assay was carried out using the WST-1 kit according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instruction (Clontech). Briefly, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 5000~20000 cells in 500 ul of complete culture medium and cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 oC for 24~48 hours prior to assay. After adding 50 \\u03bcl WST-1 reagents per well, cultures were incubated for 2 hours and the absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader. Cell migration and invasions assays were carried out as previously reported (28) and described in detail in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.  Murine Orthotopic Xenograft Model  Mouse handling and experimental procedures were approved by the Center for Animal and Comparative Medicine in Northwestern University School of Medicine in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. Athymic male nude mice (nu/nu; 6 weeks old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Orthotopic implantations were carried out as previously described (29). Briefly, a suspension of PC-3M control or FoxA1-expressing stable cells (2 \\u00d7 105 cells in 50 \\u03bcl of PBS) was injected into the mouse prostate exposed by surgery. To monitor tumor growth, mice were imaged weekly with the IVIS Spectrum In vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA).  Accession numbers  The microarray data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE37314.  Go to: RESULTS Genomic analysis reveals FoxA1 regulation of two distinct oncogenic processes  In order to shed some light on the potential functions of FoxA1, we first attempted to gain a comprehensive profile of its downstream molecules and pathways. Using FoxA1-targeting shRNA, we generated LNCaP cells with stable FoxA1 knockdown (Fig. 1A). The cells were then profiled for global gene expression using microarrays. Analysis of triplicate experiments identified 405 genes that were decreased and 516 genes increased by FoxA1 knockdown (Fig. 1B\\u2013C). Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed a random set of 11 genes (Supplementary Fig. S1A). To gain some insights into the molecular pathways in which these FoxA1-regulated genes may be involved, we carried out GO analysis (27). Our data revealed that FoxA1-induced genes, i.e., down-regulated upon FoxA1 knockdown, strongly overlap with genes that regulate cell cycle process, DNA replication, and cell division (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table S1). In good agreement with this, FoxA1-suppressed genes, on the other hand, are associated with cell apoptosis and death pathway genes (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table S2). These findings suggest a role of FoxA1 in positively regulating cell growth, being consistent with its known function as a cofactor of AR, a critical mediator of PCa growth. Indeed, microarray analysis of gene expression in control and FoxA1-knockdown cells grown in un-stimulated and androgen-stimulated medium showed that androgen and FoxA1 synergistically induce a core set of cell cycle genes in PCa (Fig. 1D).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Expression microarray analyses reveal distinct roles of FoxA1 in inducing cell growth but inhibiting cell motility Interestingly, we found that FoxA1-inhibited genes are also enriched for genes that control cell motility and EMT (Fig. 1C). This new function is in great agreement with the role of FoxA1 as an epithelial pro-differentiation factor. To understand how this role of FoxA1 relates to AR function, we analyzed aforementioned microarray data and found that the loss of FoxA1 significantly induces a core set of cell migration genes regardless of the androgen context, while androgen does not have a significant impact on their expression (Fig. 1E). Taken together, genomic analysis revealed that FoxA1 may regulate two distinct oncogenic processes, namely cell proliferation and cell motility, through AR-dependent and \\u2013independent mechanisms, respectively.  To validate this key observation and also to preclude off-target effects and potential adaptive responses from shRNA-mediated stable knockdown, we used an independent siRNA that targets a different region of the FoxA1 gene to transiently deplete FoxA1 in LNCaP cells. Microarray expression profiling and GO analysis of siFoxA1-regulated genes revealed similar enrichment of cell cycle and cell motility genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B\\u2013C, Table S3\\u20134). Moreover, this finding was further confirmed in 22RV1 cells, as an independent prostate cancer cell line model, through control and shFoxA1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S1D\\u2013E, Table S5\\u20136). In concordance with the AR-dependent and \\u2013independent roles of FoxA1, analysis of FoxA1 and AR ChIP-Seq data revealed that less than 20% of FoxA1 binding sites are co-occupied by AR, leaving over 80% binding events mediating potentially AR-independent function (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Furthermore, integrative analysis of FoxA1 ChIP-Seq and microarray data revealed that over 60% of FoxA1-regulated genes harbor at least one FoxA1 binding event within 50kb of the gene, supporting direct FoxA1 transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Fig. S1G). Next, we attempted functional assays to affirm the two disparate roles of FoxA1 in prostate carcinogenesis.  FoxA1 increases cell proliferation through the AR  To assess the effect of FoxA1 on cell proliferation, we carried out cell growth assays in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines following ectopic FoxA1 overexpression or knockdown. In LNCaP cells, we found that FoxA1 knockdown dramatically reduced cell growth (Fig. 2A) while FoxA1 overexpression promoted cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To further confirm this we performed FoxA1 knockdown in 22RV1 cells. Consistently, cell growth assay manifested greatly reduced 22RV1 cell proliferation following FoxA1 knockdown (Fig. 2B). Next, we tried to understand whether this role of FoxA1 is dependent on the AR function. To test this, we analyzed two AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3M and DU145. As these cell lines are known to express very low levels of endogenous FoxA1, we decided to overexpress FoxA1 in these cells. Interestingly, ectopic FoxA1 overexpression showed no effects on DU145 and PC-3M cell growth. This strongly suggests that FoxA1 regulation of cell growth is mediated by and dependent on the AR pathway.  Figure 2 Figure 2 FoxA1 positively regulates cell proliferation requiring the AR We next examined whether the expression of AR might sensitize PC-3M to FoxA1 regulation. To do this, we overexpressed AR, FoxA1, or both in the PC-3M cells and carried out cell growth assays. Remarkably, we found that FoxA1 overexpression indeed significantly increased the growth of AR-expressing PC-3M cells but not that of the control cells (Fig. 2E\\u2013F and Supplementary Fig. S2B). QRT-PCR analysis confirmed induced expression of known AR target genes such as PSA and TMPRSS2 by ectopic AR and FoxA1 co-expression supporting the activation of AR signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. S2C). On the other hand, we investigated whether the blockade of AR signaling in LNCaP cells might attenuate the ability of FoxA1 to regulate LNCaP cell growth. We used anti-androgen bicalutamide to block AR signaling in LNCaP cells, which led to reduced cell growth as expected. Importantly, in the presence of anti-androgen, FoxA1 knockdown no longer has a significant effect on LNCaP cell growth (Fig. 2G). Collectively, our data support that FoxA1 promotes PCa cell growth through the AR pathway and that this tumor-promoting role can be efficiently targeted by anti-androgens.  FoxA1 inhibits cell invasion independently of AR  Next we investigated the potential function of FoxA1 in inhibiting cell motility and EMT as suggested by GO analysis (Fig. 1C). To do this, we monitored cell invasion through matrigel in Boyden chamber assay and cell migration using wound-healing assay. We first examined the effect of FoxA1 overexpression on the FoxA1-low but highly invasive DU145 cells. Remarkably, our data showed a drastic reduction in the number of invaded cells upon FoxA1 overexpression (Fig. 3A). In concordance with this, wound-healing assays over a time-course revealed substantially delayed cell migration in FoxA1-expressing DU145 cells (Fig. 3B). These inhibitory effects of FoxA1 on cell migration and invasion were also observed in another independent, FoxA1-low, cell line PC-3M (Fig. 3C\\u2013D and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Expression microarray profiling confirmed at the molecular level that FoxA1 overexpression inhibits genes involved in cell motility (Supplementary Fig. S3B\\u2013C). As both DU145 and PC-3M cells do not express AR, the anti-motility role of FoxA1 is thought independent of the AR. Next we examined how this function of FoxA1 relates to that of AR using LNCaP cells.  Figure 3 Figure 3 FoxA1 inhibits PCa cell invasion and migration independent of AR Being concordant with aforementioned results, cell invasion assays demonstrated that FoxA1 knockdown in LNCaP cells resulted in dramatic increase in the number of invaded cells regardless of the AR activity, i.e., both in the presence and absence of androgen (Fig. 3E\\u2013F). Interestingly, androgen stimulation and thus AR signaling, in contrast to FoxA1, positively regulates cell invasion. In addition, FoxA1 loss and AR signaling demonstrated a synergistic effect in increasing cell invasion. Similar opposing roles of FoxA1 and AR on cell invasion were also observed in PC-3M cells with ectopic AR and/or FoxA1 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S3D\\u2013E). Therefore, the anti-motility function of FoxA1 is independent of the AR pathway and in fact directly opposes that of AR. Since increased cell motility is closely associated with EMT and our GO analysis has revealed a link between FoxA1-repressed genes with EMT (Fig. 1C), we next sought to examine whether FoxA1 might inhibit EMT.  FoxA1 suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  To delineate the potential role of FoxA1 in regulating EMT, we first measured representative EMT markers in a panel of FoxA1-positive and -negative prostate cancer cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that E-cadherin (E-Cad) is highly expressed in FoxA1-positive PCa cells including LNCaP, whereas vimentin (VIM) is significantly up-regulated in the FoxA1-negative, highly aggressive cell lines such as PC-3M and DU145 cells (Fig. 4A). FoxA1 expression in these PCa cell line panel is positively associated with the epithelial marker but negatively associated with the mesenchymal marker, supporting its potential role in inhibiting EMT. To investigate this, we examined the morphologic changes of cells with FoxA1 dys-regulation. We found that FoxA1 knockdown LNCaP cells appeared more dispersed and demonstrated an astrocyte-like, fusiform, or fibroblastic phenotype (Fig. 4B). Concomitant with this mesenchymal phenotypic change, there is a remarkable increase in VIM expression (Fig. 4C\\u2013D, Supplementary Fig. S4). We next investigated whether FoxA1 overexpression is able to reverse the highly invasive PC-3M cells that have a spindle-shaped fibroblast-like appearance typical of mesenchymal cells. Analysis of the cell morphology revealed an evident shift to a more rounded epithelial-like phenotype, indicating reversal of EMT by FoxA1 overexpression (Fig. 4E). In addition, FoxA1-expressing cells tend to grow in clusters, a phenotype characteristic of epithelial cells that maintain complete cell-to-cell contact. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, the cell contact protein E-Cad is remarkably up-regulated upon FoxA1 overexpression (Fig. 4F\\u2013G). With the role of FoxA1 in cell motility and EMT established, we next attempted to pinpoint the critical downstream genes or molecular pathways that mediate this newly identified function of FoxA1 in cell motility and EMT.  Figure 4 Figure 4 FoxA1 suppresses Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition SLUG is a critical mediator of the anti-motility function of FoxA1  We hypothesized that FoxA1 may directly regulate the expression of a critical mediator of EMT. To identify such genes, we performed integrative analysis of FoxA1 ChIP-Seq data and expression microarray data that compares control and FoxA1-knockdown LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S1G). We found SLUG, a transcription factor essential for EMT (16), as a candidate direct target of FoxA1. ChIP-Seq revealed a strong FoxA1 binding event within the intragenic region of the SLUG gene. This binding is markedly reduced upon FoxA1 knockdown (Fig. 5A). Using primers that flank this binding site, we confirmed using ChIP-PCR that FoxA1 indeed binds to this intragenic enhancer (Fig. 5B) and that this binding is reduced in FoxA1-knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). This binding event was further validated in an additional cell line model VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). We next investigated whether FoxA1 indeed regulates SLUG transcription.  Figure 5 Figure 5 SLUG is a direct target of FoxA1 and a key mediator of its anti-motility function To examine whether FoxA1 regulates SLUG gene expression, we performed FoxA1 knockdown in a panel of FoxA1-expressing PCa cell lines including LNCaP, VCaP, and 22RV1 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). QRT-PCR analysis revealed that SLUG transcript level is remarkably increased following FoxA1 knockdown, suggesting that FoxA1 inhibits SLUG expression (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, ectopic FoxA1 overexpression in a wide-range of PCa cell lines robustly suppressed SLUG gene expression regardless of the AR context (Fig. 5E, Supplementary Fig. S5C). To validate this regulation at the protein level, we carried out immunoblot analysis of LNCaP cells that have been selected for stable FoxA1 knockdown over a time-course. Our data confirmed a gradual reduction of FoxA1 protein following colony selection of knockdown cells. Importantly, SLUG protein expression steadily increased following the decrease of FoxA1 (Fig. 5F). Being consistent with this, ectopic FoxA1 overexpression, on the contrary, significantly reduced SLUG protein level (Fig. 5G).  Therefore, FoxA1 directly binds to the SLUG enhancer to inhibit its expression and this transcriptional regulation is AR-independent. In fact, we found that androgen treatment stimulates SLUG expression, demonstrating a role that is directly opposite to that of FoxA1 (Fig. 5H). FoxA1 loss and AR signaling showed a synergistic effect in drastically up-regulating SLUG expression for more than 20 fold. Similarly, we confirmed in PC-3M and DU135 cells that FoxA1 and AR overexpression regulate SLUG in opposite direction, while both increase AR-induced genes such as PSA and TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Fig. S5D\\u2013E & S2C\\u2013D). These results are consistent with our earlier observation showing their distinct functions in cell invasion but similar roles in cell growth. These data strongly suggest that SLUG may be a critical mediator of FoxA1 regulation of cell motility. To assess this, we used shRNA to block SLUG up-regulation in FoxA1-knockdown LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S5F\\u2013G). Cell invasion assays revealed that while FoxA1 knockdown dramatically induced the invasiveness of LNCaP cells, this increase was blocked by SLUG knockdown (Fig. 5I\\u2013J). It is thus clear that FoxA1 plays an important anti-motility role that is mediated by its inhibition of SLUG expression. As cell migration and invasion in vitro is tightly associated with tumor metastasis in vivo, we next investigated whether FoxA1 might inhibit xenograft prostate tumor metastasis in mice.  FoxA1 inhibits prostate cancer metastasis  As we have demonstrated that FoxA1 inhibits cell motility and SLUG expression in a diverse prostate cell lines regardless of the AR status, we chose to examine this role in vivo using one representative cell line. PC-3M cell line was selected as it is AR- (thus ideal for studying AR-independent function of FoxA1) and that its orthotopic implantation has been proven a valuable metastatic model for human prostate cancer (32). In order to trace tumors in live animals, a luciferase reporter was transfected into PC-3M cells through lentiviral infection followed by antibiotic selection of stable clones. These luciferase-expressing control and FoxA1-epxressing cells were then inoculated into the mice prostate and monitored through live mice imaging using an IVIS system (Fig. 6A). We observed xenograft tumor formation in both control and FoxA1 mice at approximately 2 weeks after implantation. There were no significant differences in tumor size between the two groups for up to 4 weeks after implantation. These findings suggest that FoxA1 overexpression does not affect PC-3M cell growth in vivo. The mice with FoxA1-expressing cells eventually developed significantly smaller regional tumors at 5 weeks after implantation (Fig. 6B). These differences in tumor size, however, are most likely due to the merge of regionally metastatic tumors in the control mice, as at 5 weeks post-inoculation the control mice had massive metastasis and had to be euthanized. Strikingly, the mice with FoxA1-expressing cells had significantly less tumor metastasis (Fig. 6C). Out of the 5 mice, only 1 mouse showed distant metastasis, while the control group had 100% metastasis. Having demonstrated the role of FoxA1 in inhibiting cell motility in vitro and xenograft tumor metastasis in vivo, we next examined its expression in human PCa.  Figure 6 Figure 6 FoxA1 inhibits xenograft prostate tumor metastasis in mice We first examined FoxA1 expression in a recent microarray dataset profiling over 150 human PCa tissues (22). Interestingly, we found that FoxA1 is marginally significantly (P = 4.4E-4) up-regulated in localized PCa when compared to benign prostate samples (Fig. 6D). Remarkably, FoxA1 is highly significantly (P = 1.2E-11) down-regulated in metastatic PCa relative to both benign and localized PCa. This interesting pattern of stage-dependent dys-regulation of FoxA1 is validated in another independent microarray dataset with a large sample size (Supplementary Fig. S6A) (33; 34). To further corroborate this finding, we carried out qRT-PCR and western blot analysis of FoxA1 expression in a panel of benign adjacent prostate, localized and metastatic PCa tissues. Our results confirmed that FoxA1 is indeed slightly up-regulated in localized PCa relative to benign tissues, but is dramatically down-regulated in metastatic PCa (Fig. 6E, Supplementary Fig. S6B\\u2013C). This disease stage-dependent expression pattern of FoxA1 precisely reflects the dual roles of FoxA1 in positively regulating cell proliferation, a cellular process that dominates primary tumors, but in negatively regulating cell motility and EMT, a process essential to tumor metastasis. We next examined in this context the functionalities of recurrent FoxA1 mutations recently reported in human PCa.  Mutant FoxA1 failed to inhibit SLUG expression and cell invasion  To investigate how FoxA1 mutations contribute to PCa progression, we generated two representative FoxA1 mutants, F400I and M253K that contain a point mutation in the transactivation and the forkhead domain, respectively. Lentivirus carrying wildtype or mutant FoxA1 genes were used to infect DU145 cells to generate stable cell lines that express either wildtype or mutant FoxA1. QRT-PCR using primers that amplify the wildtype regions confirmed FoxA1 overexpression in all three stable cell lines (Fig. 7A), while immunoblot analysis confirmed ectopic FoxA1 protein overexpression (Fig. 7B).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Mutant FoxA1 failed to inhibit SLUG expression and cell invasion With the stable cell lines established, we next examined the potential impact of the mutations on FoxA1 function. Using qRT-PCR, we demonstrated that the ability of the mutant FoxA1 to inhibit SLUG gene expression is substantially attenuated (Fig. 6C). With similar levels of overexpression, the wildtype FoxA1 suppressed SLUG expression to a level significantly lower than that by the mutants. In concordance with this, cell invasion assays revealed that while wildtype FoxA1 substantially inhibited DU145 cell invasion, the mutants only showed moderate inhibitory effects (Fig. 7D\\u2013E). Mechanistically, this attenuated function may be due to reduced binding of FoxA1 mutants on the SLUG gene enhancer as supported by ChIP-PCR, despite their unaffected localization to the nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S7A\\u2013B). Therefore, one mechanism by which recurrent FoxA1 mutations contribute to PCa progression is through tempering its ability to inhibit SLUG gene expression and thus cell motility.  Go to: DISCUSSION Understanding of FoxA1 function in PCa to date is largely limited to its regulation of AR activities. In this study, we revealed that, in addition to regulating cell cycle, FoxA1 also controls the expression of genes involved in cell motility and EMT. Importantly, this function of FoxA1 is distinct from that of AR and is independent of AR activation. Depending on the cellular context, either oncogenic or tumor suppressive function of FoxA1 may dominate. Indeed, using two large tumor expression profiling dataset we revealed that, during prostate cancer progression from benign tissue to localized PCa, and then to metastatic PCa, FoxA1 expression is firstly up-regulated (in localized PCa), and then dramatically down-regulated (in metastatic PCa). The initial up-regulation of FoxA1 may have been critical for original malignant cells to rapidly proliferate. However, the loss of FoxA1 at late-stage disease may be associated with tumor metastasis. Consistently, our xenograft studies showed FoxA1 inhibition of PCa tumor metastasis in vivo. Our discovery of this new anti-motility function of FoxA1 nicely reconciles reported discrepancy in studies associating FoxA1 expression with both good and bad prognosis. However, it needs to be noted that for these findings to be fully validated, future studies need to be done to determine FoxA1 protein level in larger cohorts of benign, cancerous and metastatic PCa tissues by western blot and/or tissue microarray analysis. Such analysis needs to be carefully carried out and interpreted considering AR status and disease stages, due to the dual roles of FoxA1 in inducing cell growth but inhibiting cell motility. It will also be useful in future studies to further dissect out the effects of FoxA1 on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo using AR+ cell lines with tetracycline-inducible FoxA1 knockdown.  Our findings of FoxA1 in inhibiting cell motility and EMT in cancer are also consistent with the role of FoxA1 during development in promoting cell differentiation. However, it is important to note that PCa progression is a complex process regulated by a large number of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. FoxA1, being one of them, may not be the whole story. For example, AR overexpression accounts for over 30% of metastatic PCa wherein FoxA1 might not be down-regulated. However, PCa cell lines that are driven by FoxA1 loss or mutation, if could be identified, will be very useful models for further characterization of the functions of wildtype and mutant FoxA1 and for the development of targeted therapy.  We pinpoint SLUG as key downstream gene that is critical for the new role of FoxA1 in inhibiting cell motility. Using FoxA1 overexpression and knockdown assays we provide strong evidence that FoxA1 inhibits SLUG gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. ChIP-Seq data revealed multiple FoxA1 binding events within the regulatory elements around SLUG, which was further confirmed by ChIP-PCR, suggesting direct regulation. However, as SLUG is a tightly regulated gene, it is very likely that additional pathways may exist and that SLUG may also be indirectly regulated by FoxA1. On the other hand, although previous studies have largely focused on FoxA1 as a transcriptional activator and a cofactor of the AR, recent studies have begun to show that AR can act directly as a transcriptional repressor (31; 36). Moreover, FoxA1 itself has been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor that is directly recruited to the RPRM promoter, interacts with HDAC7, and is necessary for estrogen-mediated repression of RPRM (37). Future studies are warranted to further examine the mechanism by which FoxA1 directly inhibits target genes such as SLUG. Moreover, our study showed that the loss of FoxA1 works in synergy with AR in inducing SLUG expression and increasing cell motility. This suggests that PCa with FoxA1 loss and AR gain may be especially dangerous. This is further supported by a recent study reporting SLUG also acting as an AR co-factor that further enhances AR signaling (38).  In this study we demonstrate evidence that while the wildtype FoxA1 drastically inhibits cell invasion, this tumor suppressive effect is greatly impaired by FoxA1 mutations that were found in patients. By contrast, no significant differences were observed in terms of their ability in regulating cell growth as recently reported (22). In addition, we show that the effect of FoxA1 in promoting cell growth is largely dependent on the AR and can be efficiently targeted by anti-androgens, which are standard first-line treatment for PCa. Therefore, instead of designing additional approaches to target FoxA1-mediated cell growth, it may be more beneficial to design therapeutic approaches to restore its favorable effect in suppressing metastasis, in combination with anti-androgen treatment. In addition, we showed SLUG as a key mediator of FoxA1 regulation of cell motility, thus providing a potential avenue for targeting the molecular subtype of prostate cancers that harbor FoxA1 mutation or loss.  In summary, this study represents the beginning of research endeavors to separate the intrinsic roles of FoxA1 from its secondary effects mediated via the AR. This study is the first to clearly demonstrate an important anti-motility function of FoxA1 in PCa that is independent of the AR. These results lead to further discovery of a critical mechanism by which recurrent FoxA1 mutations contribute to PCa progression. It is plausible that other pathways may also be involved, which will be interesting lines for future studies. In particular, it would be intriguing to determine in future studies whether the DNA binding profiles of the mutant FoxA1 are different from that of the wildtype and how they might alter the AR pathway. Taken together, our study provides a mechanistic link between recurrent FoxA1 mutations and PCa. By pinpointing the key molecular pathways involved, our findings offer unique opportunities for novel therapeutics to treat the molecular subtype of prostate cancers that harbor FoxA1 mutation or loss.  Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis.  Lung cancer is the most common cause of global cancer-related mortality, leading to over a million deaths each year and adenocarcinoma is its most common histological type. Smoking is the major cause of lung adenocarcinoma but, as smoking rates decrease, proportionally more cases occur in never-smokers (defined as less than 100 cigarettes in a life-time). Recently, molecularly targeted therapies have dramatically improved treatment for patients whose tumours harbour somatically activated oncogenessuch as mutant EGFR1 or translocated ALK, RET, orROS1 (refs 2\\u20134). Mutant BRAF and ERBB2 (ref. 5) are also investigational targets. However, mostlung adenocarcinomas either lack an identifiable driver oncogene, or harbour mutations in KRAS and are therefore still treated with conventional chemotherapy. Tumour suppressor gene abnormalities, such as those in TP53 (ref. 6), STK11 (ref. 7), CDKN2A8, KEAP1 (ref. 9), and SMARCA4 (ref. 10) are also common but are not currently clinically actionable. Finally, lung adenocarcinoma shows high rates of somatic mutation and genomic rearrangement, challenging identification of all but the most frequent driver gene alterations because of a large burden of passenger events per tumour genome11\\u201313. Our efforts focused on comprehensive, multiplatform analysis of lung adenocarcinoma, with attention towards pathobiology and clinically actionable events.  Go to: Clinical samples and histopathologic data We analysed tumour and matched normal material from 230 previously untreated lung adenocarcinoma patients who provided informed consent (Supplementary Table 1). All major histologic types of lung adenocarcinoma were represented: 5% lepidic, 33% acinar, 9% papillary, 14% micropapillary, 25% solid, 4% invasive mucinous, 0.4% colloid and 8% unclassifiable adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Fig. 1)14. Median follow-up was 19 months, and 163 patients were alive at the time of last follow-up. Eighty-one percent of patients reported pastor present smoking. Supplementary Table 2 summarizes demographics. DNA, RNA and protein were extracted from specimens and quality-control assessments were performed as described previously15. Supplementary Table 3 summarizes molecular estimates of tumour cellularity16.  Go to: Somatically acquired DNA alterations We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on tumour and germ-line DNA, with a mean coverage of 97.6\\u00d7 and 95.8\\u00d7, respectively, as performed previously17. The mean somatic mutation rate across the TCGA cohort was 8.87 mutations per megabase (Mb) of DNA (range: 0.5\\u201348, median: 5.78). The non-synonymous mutation rate was 6.86 per Mb. MutSig2CV18 identified significantly mutated genes among our 230 cases along with 182 similarly-sequenced, previously reported lung adenocarcinomas12. Analysis of these 412 tumour/normal pairs highlighted 18 statistically significant mutated genes (Fig. 1 a shows co-mutation plot of TCGA samples (n =230), Supplementary Fig. 2 shows co-mutation plot of all samples used in the statistical analysis (n =412) and Supplementary Table 4 contains complete MutSig2CV results, which also appear on the TCGA Data Portal along with many associated data files (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/luad_2014/). TP53 was commonly mutated (46%). Mutations in KRAS (33%) were mutually exclusive with those in EGFR (14%). BRAF was also commonly mutated (10%), as were PIK3CA (7%), MET (7%) and the small GTPase gene, RIT1 (2%). Mutations in tumour suppressor genes including STK11 (17%), KEAP1 (17%), NF1 (11%), RB1 (4%) and CDKN2A (4%) were observed. Mutations in chromatin modifying genes SETD2(9%), ARID1A(7%) and SMARCA4 (6%) and the RNA splicing genes RBM10 (8%) and U2AF1 (3%) were also common. Recurrent mutations in the MGA gene (which encodes a Max-interacting protein on the MYC pathway19) occurred in 8% of samples. Loss-of-function (frameshift and nonsense) mutations in MGA were mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification (Fisher\\u2019s exact test P =0.04), suggesting a hitherto unappreciated potential mechanism of MYC pathway activation. Coding single nucleotide variants and indel variants were verified by resequencing at a rate of 99% and 100%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 5). Tumour purity was not associated with the presence of false negatives identified in the validation data (P =0.31; Supplementary Fig. 3b).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Somatic mutations in lung adenocarcinoma Past or present smoking associated with cytosine to adenine (C >A) nucleotide transversions as previously described both in individual genes and genome-wide12,13. C >A nucleotide transversion fraction showed two peaks; this fraction correlated with total mutation count (R2 =0.30) and inversely correlated with cytosine to thymine (C >T) transition frequency (R2 =0.75) (Supplementary Fig. 4). We classified each sample (Supplementary Methods) into one of two groups named transversion-high (TH, n =269), and transversion-low (TL, n =144). The transversion-high group was strongly associated with past or present smoking (P < 2.2 \\u00d710\\u221216), consistent with previous reports13. The transversion-high and transversion-low patient cohorts harboured different gene mutations. Whereas KRAS mutations were significantly enriched in the transversion-highcohort (P=2.1\\u00d710\\u221213), EGFR mutations were significantly enriched in the transversion-low group (P =3.3 \\u00d710\\u22126). PIK3CA and RB1 mutations were likewise enriched in transversion-low tumours (P <0.05). Additionally, the transversion-low tumours were specifically enriched for in-frame insertions in EGFR and ERBB2 (ref. 5) and for frameshift indels in RB1 (Fig. 1b). RB1 is commonly mutated in small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). We found RB1 mutations in transversion-low adenocarcinomas were enriched for frameshift indels versus single nucleotide substitutions compared to SCLC (P <0.05)20,21 suggesting a mutational mechanism in transversion-low adenocarcinoma that is probably distinct from smoking in SCLC.  Gender is correlated with mutation patterns in lung adenocarcinoma22. Only a fraction of significantly mutated genes from the complete set reported in this study (Fig. 1a) were enriched in men or women (Fig. 1c). EGFR mutations were enriched in tumours from the female cohort (P =0.03) whereas loss-of-function mutations within RBM10, an RNA-binding protein located on the X chromosome23 were enriched in tumours from men (P =0.002). When examining the transversion-high group, 16 out of 21 RBM10 mutations were observed in males (P =0.003, Fisher\\u2019s exact test).  Somatic copy number alterations were very similar to those previously reported for lung adenocarcinoma24 (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 6). Significant amplifications included NKX2-1, TERT, MDM2, KRAS, EGFR, MET, CCNE1, CCND1, TERC and MECOM (Supplementary Table 6), as previously described24, 8q24 near MYC, and a novel peak containing CCND3 (Supplementary Table 6). The CDKN2A locus was the most significant deletion (Supplementary Table 6). Supplementary Table 7 summarizes molecular and clinical characteristics by sample. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing on a subset (n =93) of the samples revealed an average of 36 gene\\u2013gene and gene\\u2013inter-gene rearrangements per tumour. Chromothripsis25 occurred in six of the 93 samples (6%) (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 8). Low-pass whole genome sequencing-detected rearrangements appear in Supplementary Table 9.  Go to: Description of aberrant RNA transcripts Gene fusions, splice site mutations or mutations in genes encoding splicing factors promote or sustain the malignant phenotype by generating aberrant RNA transcripts. Combining DNA with mRNA sequencing enabled us to catalogue aberrant RNA transcripts and, in many cases, to identify the DNA-encoded mechanism for the aberration. Seventy-five per cent of somatic mutations identified by WES were present in the RNA transcriptome when the locus in question was expressed (minimum 5\\u00d7) (Supplementary Fig. 7a) similar to prior analyses15. Previously identified fusions involving ALK (3/230 cases), ROS1 (4/230) and RET (2/230) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 10), all occurred in transversion-low tumours (P =1.85 \\u00d7 10\\u22124, Fisher\\u2019s exact test).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Aberrant RNA transcripts in lung adenocarcinoma associated with somatic DNA translocation or mutation MET activation can occur by exon 14 skipping, which results in a stabilized protein26. Ten tumours had somatic MET DNA alterations with MET exon 14 skipping in RNA. In nine of these samples, a 5\\u2032 or 3\\u2032 splice site mutation or deletion was identified27. MET exon 14 skipping was also found in the setting of a MET Y1003* stop codon mutation (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 8a). The codon affected by the Y1003* mutation is predicted to disrupt multiple splicing enhancer sequences, but the mechanism of skipping remains unknown in this case.  S34F mutations in U2AF1 have recently been reported in lung adenocarcinoma12 but their contribution to oncogenesis remains unknown. Eight samples harboured U2AF1S34F. We identified 129 splicing events strongly associated with U2AF1S34F mutation, consistent with the role of U2AF1 in 3\\u2032-splice site selection28. Cassette exons and alternative 3\\u2032 splice sites were most commonly affected (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table 11)29. Among these events, alternative splicing of the CTNNB1 protooncogene was strongly associated with U2AF1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Thus, concurrent analysis of DNA and RNA enabled delineation of both cis and trans mechanisms governing RNA processing in lung adenocarcinoma.  Go to: Candidate driver genes The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/RAF pathway is frequently mutated in lung adenocarcinoma. Striking therapeutic responses are often achieved when mutant pathway components are successfully inhibited. Sixty-two percent (143/230) of tumours harboured known activating mutations in known driver oncogenes, as defined by others30. Cancer-associated mutations in KRAS (32%, n =74), EGFR (11%, n =26) and BRAF (7%, n =16) were common. Additional, previously uncharacterized KRAS, EGFR and BRAF mutations were observed, but were not classified as driver oncogenes for the purposes of our analyses (see Supplementary Fig. 9a for depiction of all mutations of known and unknown significance); explaining the differing mutation frequencies in each gene between this analysis and the overall mutational analysis described above. We also identified known activating ERBB2 in-frame insertion and point mutations (n =5)6, as well as mutations in MAP2K1 (n =2), NRAS and HRAS (n =1 each). RNA sequencing revealed the aforementioned MET exon 14 skipping (n =10) and fusions involving ROS1 (n =4), ALK (n =3) and RET (n =2). We considered these tumours collectively as oncogene-positive, as they harboured a known activating RTK/RAS/ RAF pathway somatic event. DNA amplification events were not considered to be driver events before the comparisons described below.  We sought to nominate previously unrecognized genomic events that might activate this critical pathway in the 38% of samples without a RTK/RAS/RAF oncogene mutation. Tumour cellularity did not differ between oncogene-negative and oncogene-positive samples (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Analysis of copy number alterations using GISTIC31 identified unique focal ERBB2 and MET amplifications in the oncogene-negative subset (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 6); amplifications in other wild-type proto-oncogenes, including KRAS and EGFR, were not significantly different between the two groups.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Identification of novel candidate driver genes We next analysed WES data independently in the oncogene-negative and oncogene-positive subsets. We found that TP53, KEAP1, NF1 and RIT1 mutations were significantly enriched in oncogene-negative tumours (P <0.01; Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 12). NF1 mutations have previously been reported in lung adenocarcinoma11, but this is the first study, to our knowledge, capable of identifying all classes of loss-of-function NF1 defects and to statistically demonstrate that NF1 mutations, as well as KEAP1 and TP53 mutations are enriched in the oncogene-negative subset of lung adenocarcinomas (Fig. 3c). All RIT1 mutations occurred in the oncogene-negative subset and clustered around residue Q79 (homologous to Q61 in the switch II region of RAS genes). These mutations transform NIH3T3 cells and activate MAPK and PI(3)K signalling32, supporting a driver role for mutant RIT1 in 2% of lung adenocarcinomas. This analysis increases the rate at which putative somatic lung adenocarcinoma driver events can be identified within the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway to 76% (Fig. 3d).  Go to: Recurrent alterations in key pathways Recurrent aberrations in multiple key pathways and processes characterize lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 4a). Among these were RTK/RAS/ RAF pathway activation (76% of cases), PI(3)K-mTOR pathway activation (25%), p53 pathway alteration (63%), alteration of cell cycle regulators (64%, Supplementary Fig. 10), alteration of oxidative stress pathways (22%, Supplementary Fig. 11), and mutation of various chromatin and RNA splicing factors (49%).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Pathway alterations in lung adenocarcinoma We then examined the phenotypic sequelae of some key genomic events in the tumours in which they occurred. Reverse-phase protein arrays provided proteomic and phosphoproteomic phenotypic evidence of pathway activity. Antibodies on this platform are listed in Supplementary Table 13. This analysis suggested that DNA sequencing did not identify all samples with phosphoprotein evidence of activation of a given signalling pathway. For example, whereas KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas had higher levels of phosphorylated MAPK than KRAS wild-type tumours had on average, many KRAS wild-type tumours displayed significant MAPK pathway activation (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 10). The multiple mechanisms by which lung adenocarcinomas achieve MAPK activation suggest additional, still undetected RTK/RAS/ RAF pathway alterations. Similarly, we found significant activation of mTOR and its effectors (p70S6kinase, S6, 4E-BP1) in a substantial fraction of the tumours (Fig. 4c). Analysis of mutations in PIK3CA and STK11, STK11 protein levels, and AMPK and AKT phosphorylation33 led to the identification of three major mTOR patterns in lung adenocarcinoma: (1) tumours with minimal or basal mTOR pathway activation, (2) tumours showing higher mTOR activity accompanied by either STK11-inactivating mutation or combined low STK11 expression and low AMPK activation and (3) tumours showing high mTOR activity accompanied by either phosphorylated AKT activation, PIK3CA mutation, or both. As with MAPK, many tumours lack an obvious underlying genomic alteration to explain their apparent mTOR activation.  Go to: Molecular subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma Broad transcriptional and epigenetic profiling can reveal downstream consequences of driver mutations, provide clinically relevant classification and offer insight into tumours lacking clear drivers. Prior unsupervised analyses of lung adenocarcinoma gene expression have used varying nomenclature for transcriptional subtypes of the disease34\\u201337. To coordinate naming of the transcriptional subtypes with the histopathological38, anatomic and mutational classifications of lung adenocarcinoma, we propose an updated nomenclature: the terminal respiratory unit (TRU, formerly bronchioid), the proximal-inflammatory (PI, formerly squamoid), and the proximal-proliferative (PP, formerly magnoid)39 transcriptional subtypes (Fig. 5a). Previously reported associations of expression signatures with pathways and clinical outcomes34,36,39 were observed (Supplementary Fig. 7b) and integration with multi-analyte data revealed statistically significant genomic alterations associated with these transcriptional subtypes. The PP subtype was enriched for mutation of KRAS, along with inactivation of the STK11 tumour suppressor gene by chromosomal loss, inactivating mutation, and reduced gene expression. In contrast, the PI subtype was characterized by solid histopathology and co-mutation of NF1 and TP53. Finally, the TRU subtype harboured the majority of the EGFR-mutated tumours as well as the kinase fusion expressing tumours. TRU subtype membership was prognostically favourable, as seen previously34 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Finally, the subtypes exhibited different mutation rates, transition frequencies, genomic ploidy profiles, patterns of large-scale aberration, and differed in their association with smoking history (Fig. 5a). Unsupervised clustering of miRNA sequencing-derived or reverse phase protein array (RPPA)-derived data also revealed significant heterogeneity, partially overlapping with the mRNA-based subtypes, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs 12 and 13.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Integrative analysis Mutations in chromatin-modifying genes (for example, SMARCA4, ARID1A and SETD2) suggest a major role for chromatin maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma. To examine chromatin states in an unbiased manner, we selected the most variable DNA methylation-specific probes in CpG island promoter regions and clustered them by methylation intensity (Supplementary Table 14). This analysis divided samples into two distinct subsets: a significantly altered CpG island methylator phenotype-high (CIMP-H(igh)) cluster and a more normal-like CIMP-L(ow) group, with a third set of samples occupying an intermediate level of methylation at CIMP sites (Fig. 5b). Our results confirm a prior report40 and provide additional insights into this epigenetic program. CIMP-H tumours often showed DNA hypermethylation of several key genes: CDKN2A, GATA2, GATA4, GATA5, HIC1, HOXA9, HOXD13, RASSF1, SFRP1, SOX17 and WIF1 among others (Supplementary Fig. 14). WNT pathway genes are significantly over-represented in this list (P value =0.0015) suggesting that this is a key pathway with an important driving role within this subtype. MYC overexpression was significantly associated with the CIMP-H phenotype as well (P =0.003).  Although we did not find significant correlations between global DNA methylation patterns and individual mutations in chromatin remodelling genes, there was an intriguing association between SETD2 mutation and CDKN2A methylation. Tumours with low CDKN2A expression due to methylation (rather than due to mutation or deletion) had lower ploidy, fewer overall mutations (Fig. 5c) and were significantly enriched for SETD2 mutation, suggesting an important role for this chromatin-modifying gene in the development of certain tumours.  Integrative clustering41 of copy number, DNA methylation and mRNA expression data found six clusters (Fig. 5c). Tumour ploidy and mutation rate are higher in clusters 1\\u20133 than in clusters 4\\u20136. Clusters 1\\u20133 frequently harbour TP53 mutations and are enriched for the two proximal transcriptional subtypes. Fisher\\u2019s combined probability tests revealed significant copy number associated gene expression changes on 3q in cluster one, 8q in cluster two, and chromosome 7 and 15q in cluster three (Supplementary Fig. 15). The low ploidy and low mutation rate clusters four and five contain many TRU samples, whereas tumours in cluster 6 have comparatively lower tumour cellularity, and few other distinguishing molecular features. Significant copy number-associated gene expression changes are observed on 6q in cluster four and 19p in cluster five. The CIMP-H tumours divided into a high ploidy, high mutation rate, proximal-inflammatory CIMP-H group (cluster 3) and a low ploidy, low mutation rate, TRU-associated CIMP-H group (cluster 4), suggesting that the CIMP phenotype in lung adenocarcinoma can occur in markedly different genomic and transcriptional contexts. Furthermore, cluster four is enriched for CDKN2A methylation and SETD2 mutations, suggesting an interaction between somatic mutation of SETD2andderegulated chromatin maintenance in this subtype. Finally, cluster membership was significantly associated with mutations in TP53, EGFR and STK11 (Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary Table 6).  Go to: Conclusions We assessed the mutation profiles, structural rearrangements, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, mRNA, miRNA and protein expression of 230 lung adenocarcinomas. In recent years, the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma has been advanced by the development of multiple therapies targeted against alterations in the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway. We nominate amplifications in MET and ERBB2 as well as mutations of NF1 and RIT1 as driver events specifically in otherwise oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas. This analysis increases the fraction of lung adenocarcinoma cases with somatic evidence of RTK/RAS/RAF activation from 62% to 76%. While all lung adenocarcinomas may activate this pathway by some mechanism, only a subset show tonic pathway activation at the protein level, suggesting both diversity between tumours with seemingly similar activating events and as yet undescribed mechanisms of pathway activation. Therefore, the current study expands the range of possible targetable alterations within the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway in general and suggests increased implementation of MET and ERBB2/HER2 inhibitors in particular. Our discovery of inactivating mutations of MGA further underscores the importance of the MYC pathway in lung adenocarcinoma.  This study further implicates both chromatin modifications and splicing alterations in lung adenocarcinoma through the integration of DNA, transcriptome and methylome analysis. We identified alternative splicing due to both splicing factor mutations in trans and mutation of splice sites in cis, the latter leading to activation of the MET gene by exon 14 skipping. Cluster analysis separated tumours based on single-gene driver events as well as large-scale aberrations, emphasizing lung adenocarcinoma\\u2019s molecular heterogeneity and combinatorial alterations, including the identification of coincident SETD2 mutations and CDKN2A methylation in a subset of CIMP-H tumours, providing evidence of a somatic event associated with a genome-wide methylation phenotype. These studies provide new knowledge by illuminating modes of genomic alteration, highlighting previously unappreciated altered genes, and enabling further refinement in sub-classification for the improved personalization of treatment for this deadly disease.   Abstract  Genomic amplification is observed in many, if not all, types of human malignancy and is one of the mechanisms for the activation of dominant-acting oncogenes in tumorigenesis. In the present study, three amplified restriction fragments were identified in an esophageal adenocarcinoma (P16) using the restriction landmark genome scanning two-dimensional gel technique. These fragments were cloned, sequenced, and mapped to chromosome band 14q13. Using the sequence tagged site-amplification mapping approach, we defined the core-amplified domain by screening 75 normal-tumor paired esophageal samples. The frequency of 14q13 amplification is 6.7% in esophageal tumors, and the amplicon spans >6 Mb in 1 tumor but is contained in a region <0.3 Mb in all of the remaining amplified tumors. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of 8 genes and expressed sequence tags located within the core-amplified domain revealed that the HNF3\\u03b1 (FOXA1) 4 gene, a forkhead gene family member, was overexpressed in all of the amplified esophageal tumors. HNF3\\u03b1 amplification was confirmed by Southern blot and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, and the results of real-time RT-PCR were consistent with that of the regular quantitative RT-PCR. Increased immunohistochemical nuclear staining of the HNF3\\u03b1 protein was detected in all of the tumors containing 14q13 amplification. Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays of 86 lung adenocarcinomas demonstrated that expression of the HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA was elevated (\\u22652.5-fold of mean expression in normal lung) in 37% (32 of 86) of the tumors analyzed. Gene amplification of HNF3\\u03b1 was detected in 2 of the 5 overexpressed lung tumors examined. This is the first report of HNF3\\u03b1 amplification, and overexpression in esophageal and lung adenocarcinomas. Amplification of HNF3\\u03b1 in esophageal and lung tumors may suggest a potential oncogenic role for this gene in tumorigenesis.  INTRODUCTION  The prognosis of patients diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma is poor, with overall 5-year survival rates of 10\\u201315% (1) . Additionally, the United States and Western countries have experienced a sharp increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma over the past 3 decades (2) . Esophageal adenocarcinoma is accompanied frequently by Barrett\\u2019s esophagus, metaplastic columnar epithelia that replace the normal squamous epithelia of the distal esophagus after chronic gastroesophageal reflux. Progression through a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence is observed (3 , 4) . However, molecular alterations leading to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma remain unclear. Therefore, characterization of the genetic lesions involved in the development and progression of this disease are of clinical importance.  Genomic amplification is commonly observed in many types of human malignancies, including esophageal adenocarcinoma. An amplified DNA segment is selected because it contains gene(s), in most cases an oncogene, that when amplified and overexpressed confers a growth advantage for cells. In humans, genomic amplification is exclusively restricted to tumor cells and is a major mechanism for the activation of dominant-acting oncogenes during tumorigenesis. Amplification of the erbB2, EGFR, and K-ras oncogenes has been identified in esophageal adenocarcinomas (5 , 6) . Genomic amplification on chromosomes 8p, 15q, and 20q has also been reported in this tumor type using comparative genomic hybridization (7) . We have previously identified and characterized a novel amplicon on 8p22 in esophageal adenocarcinomas (8) . The results suggested that two genes, cysteine protease cathepsin B and transcription factor GATA-4, were the selected targets of the 8p22\\u201323 amplification (8 , 9) . Using the RLGS 5 two-dimensional gel and STS-amplification mapping (9) approaches, we also identified and characterized an amplicon at 19q12, and the cyclin E gene was found to be the best candidate gene for selection of this amplicon (10) .  In the present study, three NotI/DpnII DNA restriction fragments identified in an esophageal adenocarcinoma (P16) demonstrated increased intensity using the RLGS two-dimensional gel approach. STS-amplification mapping was applied to the DNA from 75 normal-tumor paired esophageal samples using STS markers in the chromosomal vicinity of the three cloned restriction fragments to define the frequency and extent of amplification. We found that the core-amplified domain includes the HNF3\\u03b1 gene and the EST stSG46936. The transcription factor HNF3\\u03b1 is a member of the forkhead gene family, and the involvement of the HNF3\\u03b1 gene in liver differentiation and regeneration, embryonic gut development, and pancreatic development has been reported in rodent studies (11, 12, 13, 14) . The pathogenic significance of overexpressed HNF3\\u03b1 is currently unclear. However, the evidence from our study suggests potential oncogenic involvement for HNF3\\u03b1 in the development and/or progression of gastroesophageal and lung adenocarcinomas.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Tissue Collection.  After obtaining written consent and University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approval, 75 esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, and their corresponding normal esophagus or gastric mucosa, 20 specimens of Barrett\\u2019s metaplasia, and 114 lung adenocarcinomas were obtained from patients undergoing esophagectomy or pulmonary resection at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 1992 and 2000. Patients in this study had no preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A small portion of each tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL) and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C; the remainder was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C until use.  DNA Isolation and RLGS Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis.  High molecular weight DNA was isolated as described previously (15) . All of the tumor portions used for DNA isolation in this study contained >70% tumor cells as determined by frozen tissue sections. RLGS two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (16) . In brief, DNA from normal and tumor tissues was double-digested using the restriction enzymes NotI and EcoRV (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), and the NotI ends were filled with [\\u03b1-32P]dCTP and [\\u03b1-32P]dGTP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). First-dimensional size fractionation was performed in a 32-cm 0.9% disk-agarose gel. The resulting DNA fragments were then in-gel digested with HinfI (or DpnII for cloning purposes) and separated in the second dimension on a 5.25% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then dried and autoradiographic images obtained (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Digital images were analyzed using ImageQuant v1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Amplified DNA fragments were quantified by densitometry using the two-dimensional images from the corresponding normal tissue DNA as standards. For cloning purposes, preparative gels were run and the amplified spots were collected (8) .  Isolation and Cloning of Two-dimensional DNA Fragments.  The gel pieces containing the amplified DNA fragments were isolated and electrophoresed onto a DEAE membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The DNA was then eluted and purified as described previously (8) , and dissolved in 7 \\u03bcl of distilled water. A pBC vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was cleaved with the enzymes NotI and BamHI (DpnII compatible end), and was gel-purified using SeaKem GTG agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). Purified two-dimensional gel fragments were then incubated with 1 \\u03bcl of vector (1 ng/\\u03bcl) and 1 \\u03bcl of 10\\u00d7 ligation buffer (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) at room temperature for 10 min and at 65\\u00b0C for 7 min, and 1 \\u03bcl T4 ligase (5 ng/\\u03bcl; Boehringer Mannheim) was added. The ligation reaction was carried at 16\\u00b0C for 25 h. The ligation mixture was purified using a standard phenol:chloroform extraction protocol (17) . The XL1 Blue competent cells were then transformed with the purified plasmid DNA through electroporation using Escherichia coli Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Individual colonies were collected for DNA isolation (mini-preps) via the alkaline lysis method as described by Sambrook et al. (17) .  Electronic-PCR Analysis.  The cloned fragments were sequenced and analyzed by the BLAST tools 6 for similarity matches in the databases. Resulting sequences were used as templates to perform electronic-PCR analysis. 6 Chromosomal location of the template was determined based on an alignment to sequences in the databases.  STS-Amplification Mapping Using QG-PCR.  STS markers located in the 14q13 region were selected for quantitative PCR, as described previously (9) . In brief, PCR primers were designed to ensure that the melting temperature (Tm) of each primer set was compatible with that of the internal control (GAPDH or same chromosome control D14S72). The quantity of the normal and tumor genomic DNA was measured by a fluorometer (TKO100; Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) to ensure equity of the starting materials. Forward primers for GAPDH, D14S72 and STS markers, were end-labeled with [\\u03b3-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and the PCR products were resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. PCR product signal ratios [the intensity ratio of tumor (Ts/c) or normal (Ns/c) samples versus GAPDH control from QG-PCR] for both the tumor (Ts/c, tumor STS fragment/tumor GAPDH fragment) and normal DNA samples (Ns/c, normal STS fragment/normal GAPDH fragment) were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Values \\u22652.0 were considered indicative of DNA amplification. All of the results were repeated and verified.  Southern Blot Analysis and Interphase FISH Assay.  Ten \\u03bcg of high molecular weight DNA from paired normal-tumor tissues were loaded into a 1.0% agarose gel. DNA was blotted, and a labeled HNF3\\u03b1 probe was hybridized to the Southern filter using the protocol described previously (10) . The 459-bp probe spans the sequence of the HNF3\\u03b1 gene (NM_004496, a curated mRNA from National Center for Biotechnology Information databases) from 1485 bp to 1943 bp in the 3\\u2032 untranslated region and was selected to avoid cross-hybridization to other members of HNF3 family. All of the reagents for interphase FISH were purchased from Vysis, Inc. (Downers Grove, IL) except pepsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and Cot I DNA (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Interphase slides were made using a touch approach, and nick translation and hybridization were conducted according to the Vysis protocol with modification. A prelabeled chromosome 14q telomeric probe (Part number, 33-260014; Vysis) was cohybridized with the target probe. The BAC clone (R-356O9) that includes the HNF3\\u03b1 sequence was purchased from the BACPAC Resources (Children\\u2019s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). 7 BAC DNA was prepared using Concert High Purity Maxiprep System (Life Technologies, Inc.).  RNA Isolation and Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR.  Total RNA was isolated using TriZol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Agarose gel electrophoresis and the A260:280 ratio were used to assess RNA quality. RNA samples were stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C until use. All of the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Promega) before performing reverse transcription. Two \\u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and primed by both (dT)18 and random hexamers in a total of 20 \\u03bcl of reaction volume. Two \\u03bcl of the cDNA products underwent RT-PCR with GAPDH coamplified as an internal control. RT-PCR products were then resolved on 8% denaturing PAGE gels, and gel data were analyzed using ImageQuant software as in QG-PCR. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for HNF3\\u03b1 was performed to verify the expression levels in the tumors. HNF3\\u03b1 and GAPDH were amplified using TaqMan probes labeled with 5\\u2032 fluorescent label, 6FAM or VIC, respectively, and 3\\u2032 Quencher 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The forward and reverse primers flanking a 78-bp fragment of HNF3\\u03b1, which maps to the 3\\u2032 untranslated region of the gene and ensures the specificity of the fragment to HNF3\\u03b1, are (5\\u2032-3\\u2032) CATTGCCATCGTGTGCTTGT and CCCGTCTGGCTATACTAACACCAT, respectively. The sequence of 6FAM-labeled probe is (5\\u2032-3\\u2032) TCATCCAGTGTTATGCACTTTCCACAGTTGG. Human GAPDH primers and VIC-prelabeled probe were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems (catalogue no. 4310884E). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed and analyzed using the PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector according to instructions of the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystems).  Immunohistochemical Analysis.  Frozen specimens were sectioned at 5 \\u03bcm, placed on 0.1% poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and fixed in 100% acetone at \\u221220\\u00b0C for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched, and nonspecific binding was blocked using horse serum in PBS-1% BSA. The HNF3\\u03b1 protein was detected using an anti-HNF3\\u03b1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS-1% BSA. Immunoreactivity was detected using the Vectastain avidin/biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (18) .  Expression Analysis Using Oligonucleotide (Affymetrix) Microarrays.  Total cellular RNA was isolated from 10 normal and 86 lung adenocarcinoma samples using TriZol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was additionally purified using RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used to generate cRNA probes. Preparation of cRNA and hybridization of the HuGeneFL Arrays were performed according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix), and data analysis was performed using GeneChip 4.0 software as described previously (19) .  RESULTS  Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning Two-dimensional Gel Analysis of Esophageal Adenocarcinomas.  DNA samples from 44 primary esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, and the corresponding normal tissues were analyzed using the RLGS two-dimensional gel technique. More than 2000 individual NotI/HinfI restriction fragments were visualized and used to compare the two-dimensional images of normal and tumor DNA (Fig. 1) \\u21d3 . Comparison of one esophageal adenocarcinoma, P16 (Fig. 1B) \\u21d3 , with its corresponding normal tissue (Fig. 1A) \\u21d3 revealed a NotI/HinfI fragment with increased intensity in the tumor that was 4400 bp in the first dimension and 420 bp in the second dimension. The tumor DNA was digested with NotI/DpnII restriction enzymes for cloning purposes (Fig. 1C) \\u21d3 . Two NotI/DpnII fragments, P16\\u20131 and P16\\u20132, were found to share the sequences near the NotI cut-site (Table 1 \\u21d3 ; Fig. 1C \\u21d3 ), indicating that two DpnII restriction sites are located within their respective NotI/EcoRV fragments separated on one-dimensional gel. Three distinct fragments (P16\\u20131, P16\\u20132, and P16\\u20133) with increased intensity were collected from the two-dimensional gels, and the DNA was extracted and purified. Shown in the enlarged thumb view of Fig. 1C \\u21d3 is fragment P16\\u20132 from tumor P16. The very intense fragments visible on these gels represent ribosomal DNA, which are present in multiple copies in the genome.  Fig. 1. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 1. RLGS two-dimensional gel analysis of DNA from normal and tumor tissues from patient P16. Two-dimensional PAGE gel was used to separate the NotI/HinfI DNA fragments from normal tissue from patient P16 (A) and the corresponding adenocarcinoma (B). NotI/DpnII digestion was performed for cloning purposes (C). Cloned NotI/DpnII fragments P16\\u20131, P16\\u20132, and P16\\u20133 are shown (arrows; C). The enlarged thumb view of fragment P16\\u20132 is shown in normal (A, bottom panel) and tumor (B and C, bottom panel) two-dimensional gel images. View inlineView popup Table 1 Cloned RLGS two-dimensional fragments from NotI/DpnII preparative gels Chromosome Localization of Amplified Two-dimensional Fragments.  Amplified fragments were cloned, sequenced, and subject to a BLAST search for similarity match. Both P16\\u20131 and P16\\u20132 were matched to a sequence of the same BAC clone R-356O9 (GenBank accession no. AL121790), which is mapped to the chromosomal band 14q13. Fragment P16\\u20133 was matched to BAC clone R-964E11 (GenBank accession no. AL079303), which is also located at 14q13 (Table 1) \\u21d3 . Fragments P16\\u20131, P16\\u20132, and P16\\u20133 are all contained within the same contig, NT_010164, indicating a close genetic linkage of all three of the two-dimensional fragments. Fragment P16\\u20132 was confirmed as part of the sequence of the HNF3\\u03b1 gene, and the sequence of the P16\\u20133 fragment was found to overlap the sequence of gene PAX9 (Table 1) \\u21d3 .  Defining and Characterizing the Core-amplified Domain of the 14q13 Amplicon Using the STS-Amplification Mapping Approach.  To define the core-amplified domain and determine the frequency of the 14q13 amplification present in esophageal adenocarcinomas, >13 STS or gene markers, spanning a distance >6 Mb in the vicinity of the cloned genomic fragments, were selected by searching the NCBI, Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research, and Stanford Human Genome Center databases. QG-PCR analysis was applied to DNA from 75 normal-tumor paired esophageal samples with these markers (Fig. 2A \\u21d3 ; Fig. 3 \\u21d3 ). The housekeeping gene GAPDH, located on 12p13, was coamplified in every reaction as an internal control. D14S72, which maps to centromeric chromosome band 14q11, was coamplified with target genes or STS markers in additional reactions as a chromosome 14 control to exclude aneuploidy as the cause of increased DNA dosage in the tumors containing the 14q13 amplicon. GAPDH and D14S72 were PCR coamplified before the targeted assays for each normal-tumor pair to ensure that D14S72 is not increased in copy number in the tumors examined. DNA copy number of D14S72 was found to parallel that of GAPDH between normal and tumor DNAs in all of the tumors tested (data not shown). This indicates that the 14q13 amplicon represents an intrachromosomal amplification and that aneuploidy is not the cause of increased DNA content in amplified tumors. This is consistent with the results of interphase FISH, where a telomeric 14q (14q32) probe and a HNF3\\u03b1 containing BAC probe (R-356O9) were cohybridized to the tumor sections (Fig. 6, B and C) \\u21d3 . Therefore, D14S72 can be used as a reference marker to more accurately reflect copy number of amplified genomic fragments at 14q13 in a QG-PCR assay. Increased DNA dosage (value \\u22652.0) was observed in amplified tumors (Fig. 2A) \\u21d3 . The frequency of the 14q13 amplification is 6.7%, and the amplicon spans \\u223c6 Mb in tumor P16 and is contained in a region <0.3 Mb in all of the remaining amplified tumors (Fig. 2A \\u21d3 and Fig. 3 \\u21d3 ). The core-amplified domain of this amplicon maps between markers AA029430 and Stanford Human Genome Center-103312 (Fig. 3) \\u21d3 , a distance of \\u223c254 kb based on the physical maps from the NCBI. The transcription factor, HNF3\\u03b1, resides in the core-amplified domain (Fig. 3) \\u21d3 . Genomic coamplification of the PAX9 (cloned two-dimensional fragment P16\\u20133) and the NKX-2.8 genes, an oncogene 80 kb centromeric to PAX9, with HNF3\\u03b1 was only observed in tumor P16 (Fig. 3) \\u21d3 . The copy number of the NFKBIA gene (IKBA or MAD-3) was not found to be increased in any tumors examined.  Fig. 2. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 2. A, the QG-PCR assay was used to map the core-amplified domain and to characterize the 14q13 amplicon in 75 esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas. The D14S72 marker or housekeeping gene GAPDH (in sample F36, O65, and R06) was coamplified as an internal control. The D14S72 marker was selected as a syntenic control to more accurately distinguish the difference in DNA copy number between normal and tumor tissues. STS markers neighboring the cloned fragments were selected from the databases (Table 1) \\u21d3 . Shown here is a representative QG-PCR gel image from the 5 tumors containing the 14q13 amplicon and 2 not possessing the 14q13 amplicon (tumor O65). Three tumors, P16, R06, and S51, were amplified at stSG46963. Marker stSG43208 (gene HNF3\\u03b1), which is closely linked to stSG46963, was amplified in 5 tumors shown.

Tumor P16 possesses the largest amplicon, spanning >6 Mb. Marker stSG43208 (gene HNF3\\u03b1), demonstrates the highest frequency of amplification in 75 tumors examined. Verification of Amplification on Chromosome Band 14q13.  Southern blot analysis was performed on three pairs of esophageal normal-tumor samples using a HNF3\\u03b1-specific probe, and gene amplification of HNF3\\u03b1 was verified in tumor P16 (Fig. 2B) \\u21d3 . Interphase FISH was conducted to examine 14q13 regional changes in sectioned esophageal tumors using a 200-kb HNF3\\u03b1 containing BAC probe. FISH images demonstrated an apparent increase in copy number of the 14q13 region in the tumors containing 14q13 amplicon, whereas the telomeric region of 14q remained unchanged in the same tumors, indicating a nonaneuploid status of chromosome 14 for these tumors and that the gene amplification of HNF3\\u03b1 is not a result of increased numbers of chromosome 14 (Fig. 6, B and C) \\u21d3 . Tumor P16 demonstrated a highly increased DNA dosage of the 14q13 band with hybridization of the HNF3\\u03b1 containing BAC probe as compared with its cohybridized telomeric 14q probe (Fig. 6B) \\u21d3 . However, the FISH images might not ultimately discriminate whether the increased genomic dosage at region 14q13 constitutes a homogenously staining region, double minute, or other chromosomal rearrangements, e.g., chromosomal translocation. Consistent with the QG-PCR results (Fig. 2A) \\u21d3 , a low increase in copy number of HNF3\\u03b1 was confirmed in tumor I34, where three or more green spots (HNF3\\u03b1 containing BAC probe) were observed (Fig. 6C) \\u21d3 . In contrast, the amount of genomic DNA at region 14q13 in tumor O65 is paralleled comparatively with the amount at 14q32 (Fig. 6D) \\u21d3 , which is consistent with the QG-PCR and Southern blot results.  Real-Time Quantitative PCR Reveals Increased Expression of the HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA.  Quantitative RT-PCR was applied to amplified tumors and a few tumors not containing the 14q13 amplicon to investigate the expression level of 8 genes and ESTs within or near the core-amplified region (Table 2 \\u21d3 ; Fig. 4 \\u21d3 ). HNF3\\u03b1 was found to be overexpressed in all of the amplified tumors. HNF3\\u03b1 exhibits the most frequent rate of both overexpression and amplification among the examined 8 genes and ESTs (Table 2) \\u21d3 located within or near the core amplified domain (\\u223c254 kb). This suggests that HNF3\\u03b1 is the best candidate for selection in the 14q13 amplicon. Moreover, HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA expression data, analyzed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR of an HNF3\\u03b1-specific sequence, are consistent with the results from conventional quantitative RT-PCR (Table 2) \\u21d3 .

Overexpression of the HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA was found in all tumors amplified (P16, R06, F36, S51, and I34) and was the most frequently overexpressed gene of the 8 genes/ESTs tested. It was verified by real-time RT-PCR approach (see Table 2 \\u21d3 ).

Tumor P16 demonstrates intense HNF3\\u03b1 nuclear staining in the immunohistochemical assay (F) as compared with the section of the same tumor not receiving the primary antibody (negative control; E). An esophageal tumor (I34), observed low increase in DNA copy number, demonstrates low-level nuclear staining in a majority of tumor cells (G). A tumor not containing HNF3\\u03b1 amplification demonstrates a sporadic nuclear staining of HNF3\\u03b1 (H). DISCUSSION  Genomic amplification is associated frequently with an increased copy number of an oncogene or other cancer-related genes in human malignancy. Using the RLGS two-dimensional gel approach, we identified three amplified NotI/DpnII fragments in an esophageal adenocarcinoma (P16). The fragments were cloned, sequenced, and mapped to chromosome band 14q13. The core-amplified domain of the 14q13 amplicon was subsequently defined and characterized. The amplicon extends >6 Mb, and the core-amplified domain is contained in a region <0.3 Mb, which includes the HNF3\\u03b1 gene (Table 1) \\u21d3 . Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that HNF3\\u03b1 is overexpressed in all 5 of the amplified tumors (Table 2) \\u21d3 . Nuclear staining of the HNF3\\u03b1 protein was observed in the esophageal tumors containing the HNF3\\u03b1 amplicon. Amplification and overexpression of HNF3\\u03b1 were also found in lung adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of the HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA can be gene amplification dependent and independent, because elevated expression of this gene was observed not only in the tumor RNA, which possesses HNF3\\u03b1 gene amplification, but also in lung tumor RNAs not containing gene amplification. This is the first study to report and characterize the 14q13 amplification in esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas as well as in lung adenocarcinomas.  During the preparation of this manuscript, amplification of chromosome band 14q13 was reported in cell lines derived from esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (20) . The minimal common region of amplification was 4 Mb with 7 genes named as the candidates for the amplicon. One of the most frequently amplified genes in that study, NFKBIA, which is 2.6 Mb centromeric to HNF3\\u03b1, was not found amplified in any of the 75 primary esophageal adenocarcinomas examined in the present study. The analyses of genomic DNA amplification, and mRNA and protein expression in these tumors indicate that HNF3\\u03b1 is a strong candidate for the 14q13 amplicon in our series of esophageal adenocarcinomas. Analyses of virtual Northern and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data indicated that increased expression of HNF3\\u03b1 is observed in cell lines derived from prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. 6 High expression of the HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA has also been observed in a luminal subtype of primary breast carcinomas (21) . Increased HNF3\\u03b1 mRNA expression in many tumor types indicates a possible role for HNF3\\u03b1 in the development or progression of many cancers.  HNF3\\u03b1 (FOXA1) belongs to the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) gene family, which includes HNF3\\u03b2 (FOXA2) and HNF3\\u03b3 (FOXA3). HNF3\\u03b1 encodes a polypeptide of 473 amino acids in humans (22) . The HNF3 genes are members of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins (23) , all of which contain a highly conserved 110-amino acid forkhead motif, a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif, first identified in the Drosophila gene fork head (fkh; Ref. 11 ). HNF3\\u03b1 is expressed in embryonic endoderm and adult tissues of endodermal origin, including stomach, intestines, liver, and lung (24) . Recently, expression of the secreted signaling factor sonic hedgehog (Shh) in mice has been shown to be regulated by an HNF3-dependent mechanism (25) . Overexpression of Shh in mice has been associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma (26) .  Forkhead-family genes have been associated previously with cancer and leukemia, but our report is the first example of amplification and overexpression in primary tumors of the esophagus and lung. Breakpoints within the forkhead domain of two forkhead-family genes, FOXO4 and FOXO2, have been found to be associated with chromosomal translocations in acute lymphocyte leukemia and secondary acute leukemia (27 , 28) . Translocation involving another forkhead family gene, FOXO1a, has also been associated with pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (29) . Oncogenic transformation was observed when the fused gene of PAX3 and FOXO1a was transfected into chicken embryo fibroblasts (30) . In addition, the Foxg1b (qin) oncogene, a member of the forkhead/HNF3 family of transcriptional regulators, has been found to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts and induce fibrosarcomas in chickens (31 , 32) . A deletion of the winged helix forkhead domain of the qin gene was shown to completely abrogate the oncogenic capacity of qin/foxg1b in chicken embryo fibroblasts, indicating the necessity of the forkhead domain for the transforming activity of the gene (32) . Interestingly, several forkhead family genes, e.g., FOXA1(HNF3\\u03b1), FOXG1A, and FOXG1B (QIN) are clustered and located at 14q13, 6 but both FOXG1A and FOXG1B are outside our 14q13 amplicon. Evidence from our study and oncogenic properties of other members of the forkhead gene family suggest a potential oncogenic role for HNF3\\u03b1 (FOXA1) in the development and/or progression of esophageal and lung adenocarcinomas.\",\n          \" In contrast to other primary epidermal growth factor receptor (_EGFR_) mutations in lung adenocarcinomas, insertions in exon 20 of _EGFR_ have been generally associated with resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Their molecular spectrum, clinicopathologic characteristics, and prevalence are not well established. Tumors harboring _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions were identified through an algorithmic screen of 1,500 lung adenocarcinomas. Cases were first tested for common mutations in _EGFR_ (exons 19 and 21) and _KRAS_ (exon 2) and, if negative, further analyzed for _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions. All samples underwent extended genotyping for other driver mutations in _EGFR_, _KRAS_, _BRAF, ERBB2/HER2_, _NRAS_, _PIK3CA_, _MEK1_, and _AKT_ by mass spectrometry; a subset was evaluated for _ALK_ rearrangements. We identified 33 _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion cases [2.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.63.1], all mutually exclusive with mutations in the other genes tested (except _PIK3CA_). They were more common among never-smokers (_P_ &lt; 0.0001). There was no association with age, sex, race, or stage. Morphologically, tumors were similar to those with common _EGFR_ mutations but with frequent solid histology. Insertions were highly variable in position and size, ranging from 3 to 12 bp, resulting in 13 different insertions, which, by molecular modeling, are predicted to have potentially different effects on erlotinib binding. _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion testing identifies a distinct subset of lung adenocarcinomas, accounting for at least 9% of all _EGFR_-mutated cases, representing the third most common type of _EGFR_ mutation after exon 19 deletions and L858R. Insertions are structurally heterogeneous with potential implications for response to EGFR inhibitors. _Mol Cancer Ther; 12(2); 2209. 2012 AACR_.  This article is featured in Highlights of This Issue, [p. 119](/lookup/volpage/12/119?iss=2)  ## Introduction  The identification of activating mutations within the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (_EGFR_) has transformed the management of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancers. Starting with the initial studies, 2 mutation types have been recognized as the most prevalent and clinically significant: in-frame deletions in exon 19 and the point mutation L858R (13). Together, these represent approximately 90% of all _EGFR_ mutations, and their association with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is well characterized. Mutations involving codons G719 and L861 are also associated with sensitivity but their incidence is much lower.  Insertions in exon 20 are included among the rarer activating mutations in the TK domain of _EGFR_ (49). They represent a combination of in-frame insertions and/or duplications of 3 to 21 base pairs (bp), predominantly clustered between codons 767 and 774. Importantly, in contrast to the more classic activating _EGFR_ mutations, these insertions have been associated with _de novo_ resistance to approved _EGFR_-TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib; refs. 1014) and to irreversible inhibitors that have recently entered clinical trials (neratinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib; refs. 1016). _In vitro_ studies show that cells harboring some of the most prevalent insertions require an average of 100-fold higher concentrations of these agents for inhibition, well beyond clinically achievable plasma levels. Clinical studies, although limited, confirm the preclinical findings (6, 8, 9, 12, 1520), but rare cases with better clinical responses have been reported (8, 18, 20). Importantly, many of the insertions identified in patient samples have not been tested against these inhibitors. Further understanding of the biology, prognostic, and predictive implications of these mutations is needed but has remained limited by the small number of patients included in clinical trials and the lack of preclinical models, such as patient-derived cell lines or genetically engineered mouse models.  Despite the importance of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions as potentially targetable driver mutations, to date, only a few reports have been dedicated to these tumors and most have been confined to East Asian populations. In this setting, with the exception of EGFR-TKI sensitivity, the clinical and pathologic characteristics seem to closely match those of the classic _EGFR_ mutations, including predilection for females, never-smokers, and adenocarcinoma histology. While the true incidence of these mutations is not yet well defined, with reports ranging from 0% to 13% (4, 68, 21, 22), reviews have suggested that insertions in exon 20 may represent up to 4% of all _EGFR_ mutations (23). The incidence, clinicopathologic characteristics, and molecular spectrum of these mutant tumors remain to be explored in the U.S. population.  The aim of the current study was (i) to determine the frequency and molecular spectrum of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions in a large cohort of patients with lung adenocarcinomas, (ii) to assess the clinical and histopathologic characteristics, and (iii) to confirm their mutually exclusive nature with mutations in _EGFR_, _KRAS_, _BRAF_, _ERBB2_/_HER2_, _NRAS_, _PIK3CA_, _MAP2K1/MEK1_, and _AKT_ as well as _ALK_ rearrangements.  ## Materials and Methods  ### Patients and mutation analysis  Clinical cases of lung adenocarcinomas received for routine _EGFR_ and _KRAS_ testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) between January 2009 and January 2011 were selected for the study, under an Institutional Review Board-approved waiver. The study period was chosen to allow a minimum of 1 year of potential follow-up time.  Clinical testing for the detection of major mutations in _EGFR_ (exon 19 deletions and L858R) and KRAS (exon 2) was carried out by fragment analysis and Sanger sequencing, respectively, using previously described methods (24, 25). Extended mutation analysis for other recurrent point mutations in _EGFR_, _KRAS_, _BRAF_, _ERBB2_/_HER2_, _NRAS_, _AKT_, _MAP2K1_, and _PIK3CA_ was conducted in all cases by mass spectrometry genotyping (Sequenom) as previously described (26). Briefly, samples were subjected to a series of multiplexed assays designed to interrogate a total of 92 nonsynonymous mutations in 6 multiplex reactions (see Supplementary Table S1 for complete list of tested mutations). Amplification and single base pair extension primers were designed with the Sequenom Assay Designer v3.1 software. Allele- specific single base extension products were quantitatively analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) on the Sequenom MassArray Spectrometer. All automated system mutation calls were confirmed by manual review of the spectra. All testing was carried out in duplicate.  When sufficient tissue was available, samples that were _EGFR/KRAS_ wild-type were also tested for _ALK_ rearrangements by fluorescent _in situ_ hybridization (Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit) using standard protocols (Supplementary Fig. S1 outlines the sequential genotyping algorithm).  ### Testing for _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions  Assessment for insertions in exon 20 of _EGFR_ primarily targeted cases known to be negative for major _EGFR_ (exon 19 del, L858R) and _KRAS_ mutations, given previous reports of their mutual exclusivity and further based on DNA availability. Initial screening was conducted by a sizing assay (24, 27) using primers FW1:5-TCTTCACCTGGAAGGGGTCCA-3 and REV1:5-Fam-TGCCACCTCCACTCCGTCTA-3). Positive cases were characterized by Sanger sequencing using primers FW1:5-CATTCATGCGTCTTCACCTG-3 and REV1:5-GTATAGGGGTACCGTTTGAG-3 following previously described protocols.  To confirm the mutually exclusivity of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions with major _EGFR_ and _KRAS_ mutations, as well as other rarer mutations not well represented in our cohort, we tested a separate set of adenocarcinomas with a known positive mutation profile and sufficient DNA. Also, to confirm that mutations were confined to adenocarcinomas, we tested sets of squamous and small cell carcinomas following similar protocols.  ### Histopathology  Morphologic analysis was conducted by semiquantitatively recording 6 patternslepidic (bronchioalveolar), acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid, and mucinous (28). The distribution of morphologic patterns in adenocarcinomas with exon 20 insertions was compared with a control group of adenocarcinomas with canonical _EGFR_ mutations. The groups were compared by 2-tailed Fisher exact test.  ### Statistical analysis  The association between _EGFR_ mutation status and clinical and biologic characteristics was analyzed by Fisher exact test. Age differences were compared using the _t_ test for independent samples. The 2-sided significance level was set at _P_ &lt; 0.05.  ### Prediction of functional impact of exon 20 insertions  To examine the likelihood that previously unreported mutations identified in our series would have similar impact on the function of the protein, we used a computational biology approach using the publicly available Mutation Assessor software as described in detail elsewhere (29).  ## Results  ### Initial screening  A total of 1,500 adenocarcinomas were reviewed for the study and screened under the clinical and extended mass spectrometry genotyping assays. Of these, 901 were positive for mutations (60%, 901 of 1,500), 36 had _ALK_ rearrangements (437 tested), and 563 had no alterations detected. The latter group of tumors was termed pan-negative. The detailed distribution of mutations is outlined in Supplementary Table S2.  ### _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion testing  A total of 600 cases were tested. This included 464 pan-negative tumors (of the 563 above cases negative for all other mutations and _ALK_ rearrangements) and 136 mutation-positive tumors as specified in Supplementary Table S3. We could not test the remaining 99 of the 563 pan-negative cases due to unavailable material. Among the tested group, we detected 33 insertion mutations (6% of tested, 7% of the pan-negative set), all mutually exclusive with other genetic alterations except for 2 with concurrently mutated _PIK3CA_ (both H1047R). Insertions of 9 bps were the most common mutation type (48%, 16 of 32). Sanger sequencing of 32 positive cases showed all mutations were confined to the 5 end of the exon, between codons A763 and C775 comprising duplications and insertions as outlined in Table 1. At the amino acid level, mutations were highly variable with 13 different types identified. One sample harbored a concurrent D770N point mutation. The specific insertion sequence could not be ascertained in one tumor (6-bp insertion) with very low mutant peaks due to very low tumor content. _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions represented 9% (33 of 367) of all _EGFR_-mutated tumors (Fig. 1).

No _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions were found among 105 squamous cell carcinomas and 8 small cell carcinomas tested.  ### Morphologic features  Morphologically, all tumors were highly heterogeneous with a mixture of various patterns. Predominant patterns included acinar/papillary/micropapillary (_n_ = 21; 70%), lepidic (_n_ = 5; 17%), and solid (_n_ = 4; 13%); all tumors were entirely nonmucinous. This distribution of morphologic patterns was similar to the control group of 36 adenocarcinomas with classic sensitizing _EGFR_ mutations in exon 19 and 21, although tumors with exon 20 insertions showed a trend for a greater proportion of solid component, but this was not statistically significant (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S2).  ### Predicted functional impact  Computational prediction of the functional impact of exon 20 insertions showed functional scores ranging from 2 to 3.6 corresponding to the medium to high functional impact categories. Insertions in codons 762 and 766 affect residues conserved in the entire family of tyrosine kinases; insertions in codons 768 to 769 affect residues conserved in the large specific subfamily of EGFR homologs; insertions in codons 774 and 775 affect residues that are conserved both across all tyrosine kinase homologs and within the specific EGFR subfamily. The point mutation D770N, concurrently found with one H773_V774insNPH, had a low impact score of 1.2 and not likely to be comparable with the impact of the associated insertion.  ### Clinical characteristics  The clinical characteristics of patients with tumors harboring _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions are summarized in Table 2. Sixty-seven percent of patients were female, 48% were never-smokers, and 12% were of Asian descent. When compared with patients whose tumors lacked them, _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions were more common among never smokers (_P_ &lt; 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in age, sex, ethnic origin, or stage at diagnosis. No significant differences were noted in comparison to patients with classic sensitizing _EGFR_ mutations (including _EGFR_ exon 19 del, L858R, L861Q, and G719 mutations). The proportion of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions among all _EGFR_ mutations was the same (9%) for both the Caucasian and the Asian patient subsets.

Clinical characteristics of patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions and comparison to all other patients and to patients with other EGFR mutations  ### Response to treatment and survival analysis  Of the 33 patients with exon 20 insertions, 5 received erlotinib for advanced disease: 1 patient with A763_Y764insFQEA was treated with erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy and had partial response; 1 patient with V774_C775insHV was treated with a combination of chemotherapy and gefitinib with partial response followed by 1 year of erlotinib maintenance before disease progression, at which time he was switched to neratinib without benefit; 2 patients with D770_N771insGT and V774_C775insHV were treated with erlotinib as single agent with no response. Finally, one patient with V769_D770insASV was lost to follow-up.  For the 15 patients who presented with advanced disease, the median overall survival was more than 4 years. These patients received combinations of standard chemotherapies including cisplatin or carboplatin with a taxane or pemetrexed. Two patients with remarkable survival had multimodality therapies, 1 with resection of multifocal lung lesions and another with unilateral surgery and contralateral radiation therapy. Both patients had prolonged disease control with these interventions. Other patients received standard chemotherapy agents with typical or less-than-average duration of benefit.  ## Discussion  Insertions in exon 20 are a subset of activating _EGFR_ mutations primarily known for their reported association with _de novo_ resistance to TKIs. To date, however, few studies have focused on this subset, each confined to a limited number of mutation-positive East Asian patients (49). Many of the mutations appear in the literature a single time, some anecdotally associated with response to EGFR inhibitors. It is therefore difficult, even with the combination of these studies, to draw conclusions as to the true prevalence of these mutations, their molecular spectrum, clinicopathologic characteristics or their pattern of resistance. Table 3 summarizes the largest studies and the mutations identified.  View this table:    * View inline   * [View popup](/highwire/markup/42272/expansion?width=1000&height=500&iframe=true&postprocessors=highwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media%2Chighwire_embed)  Table 3.  Largest studies reporting lung cancers harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions  To our knowledge, our study represents the largest assessment for _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions and the most comprehensive analysis for other mutations in the same cohort. We used an algorithmic approach for our initial screening, focusing on the group negative for major mutations in _EGFR_ and _KRAS_, given the previous reports of their mutually exclusive relationship (7). On the basis of this analysis, we identified 33 patients with insertions, corresponding to 9% of all _EGFR_-mutated samples. We estimate, however, that the true incidence may be even higher, closer to 11%, factoring in the expected positive cases, which would have been detected if our entire driver mutation-negative group had been tested (99 mutation negative samples were not tested due to unavailable DNA). This rate has been further validated by our subsequent clinical testing data for the year 2011, following the inclusion of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion analysis as part of our standard reflex testing of clinical samples. During an 8-month period, 19 additional _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion cases were detected among 179 _EGFR_-mutant samples [19 of 179 or 11%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 716]. This rate is consistent with the highest rates previously reported in smaller studies (6, 7), confirming that exon 20 insertions are the third most common _EGFR_ mutation after exon 19 deletions and L858R. The overall underestimation of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions in the literature may reflect the fact that many studies have focused on the 2 major mutations and that indels, especially in the setting of low tumor content, may occasionally be mistaken for high background on Sanger sequencing traces, a pitfall that is avoided by the simple and more sensitive PCR product sizing assay used in the present study.  We estimate that the overall incidence of _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions among all adenocarcinomas is approximately 3%. Through concurrent extended mass spectrometry genotyping and additional testing of known positive _EGFR_ and _KRAS_ cases, we also confirmed the mutually exclusive nature of these mutations with all other tested oncogenes, with the exception of _PIK3CA_. The coexistence of _PIK3CA_ mutations with other oncogene mutations is a frequent event in lung adenocarcinomas (30).  At the molecular level, in agreement with prior studies (7, 8, 11), we found that insertions in exon 20 are all in-frame and confined to the proximal region of the exon, between codons 763 and 775. Compared with other studies, we identified greater heterogeneity with 13 different mutation types within the hotspot region, varying significantly in size and position. Insertions such as V769_D770insASV, previously considered among the most prevalent insertions (7, 8, 23), represented only 12% (4 of 33) of the mutations in our series. In contrast, the rarely reported mutation A763_Y764insFQEA, a duplication spanning the intronexon junction (Fig. 2), represented 9% of all cases and several other insertions had not been previously reported. On the basis of our experience over a 3-year period, we have identified 20 different insertions, confirming their wide variability. This degree of heterogeneity is unlike other insertions such as those in exon 19 of _EGFR_ (31) or in exon 20 of _HER2_ (32), where the vast majority of inserted sequences share the same length and amino acid content. Similarly, contrasting features can even be noted in comparison with _EGFR_ deletions, which involve a common defining region within E746 to A750 (Fig. 3). How this structural heterogeneity may impact on biologic behavior and response to targeted therapy is not yet known. Computational analysis of these mutations predicts that all insertions, regardless of length and amino acid composition, would confer a significant functional impact by affecting the evolutionary conserved protein regions.

Insertions in exon 20 of _EGFR_ show higher heterogeneity compared to both _HER2_ and _EGFR_ exon 19. Most insertions in _HER2_ are represented by the A775_G776insYVMA, whereas insertions in exon 19 of _EGFR_ all share the inserted sequence PVAI and are located in the same region I744-E746.  To further explore the possible functional differences between the different _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions, we examined their effect on the 3-dimensional structure of the EGFR kinase domain. These _in silico_ molecular modeling studies showed that the various insertions are predicted to interact differently with the erlotinib-binding region. Those involving amino acids 764 to 770 showed the least interaction with the drug-binding pocket. In contrast, insertions between A763 and 764 are predicted to cause significant rearrangement of the C helix, which could markedly reduce drug affinity. Insertions in the more distal region of the hotspot, particularly those affecting the 773 to 775 region would affect the drug-binding pocket directly, predicting the most significant obstructive effect on erlotinib binding. These predictions suggest a basis for the observed variability of response to erlotinib in patients with different _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions. A better understanding of the biology of these mutations is therefore needed and will require further research into the structure of a wide variety of insertions and the development of additional preclinical models. On the basis of available literature and our present findings, it appears that insertions between codons 769 and 775, despite variable length or amino acid composition, are associated with resistance to currently approved EGFR-TKIs (6, 8, 9, 12) and to irreversible inhibitors entering clinical trials (15, 16). It should be mentioned that mutations such as the A767_V769dupASV and S768_D770dupAVD, commonly associated with resistance, do not involve codons 767 or 768 but represent a duplication of the indicated wild-type sequence inserted distally between 769 and 770 and 770 and 771, respectively. In contrast, we found no specific literature to support a resistance pattern for mutations in the region between codons 762 and 768, which would encompass mutations A763_Y764insFQEA, A767_S768insTLA, V765insHH, and M766_A767insAI. In fact, 2 patients with tumors harboring the latter 2 mutations have been reported to show prolonged periods of disease control with reversible EGFR-TKIs (18, 33). Of interest, the point mutation S768I in this region, also associated with _de novo_ resistance, has been reported to show different responses to TKIs depending on the presence of other mutations; specifically, S768I has been associated with resistance when found in conjunction with G719A (8) or V769L (34) but not with L858R.(8) In our series, we identified 5 patients with the S768I mutation, one in conjunction with G719A but none were treated with TKIs. Also, we note the incidental finding of a D770N mutation concurrently with an H773_V774insNPH. While this mutation has been previously reported (35), its association with resistance is not established. In our computational assessment, this mutation had a low score, predicting no functional impact.  In terms of clinical characteristics, patients with _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions were more often never-smokers, but there was no clear association with age, sex, or race. The subset of patients with advanced disease had variable clinical outcomes following either chemotherapy or multimodality interventions. This treatment heterogeneity precluded a rigorous analysis of the prognostic significance of these mutations. However, among the 3 patients who received single-agent EGFR-TKIs, harboring mutations D770_N771insGT and V774_C775insHV, there were no objective responses to therapy.  In conclusion, we find that _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions are a highly heterogeneous family of activating mutations with an incidence that is notably higher than previously reported, placing them as the third most common _EGFR_ mutation after _EGFR_ exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation. The high variability identified in these mutations may confer diversity in biologic behavior and response to targeted therapies, arguing against their blanket designation as non-responsive mutations. Given the high incidence of lung adenocarcinomas, we estimate that testing could identify more than 5,000 patients with these mutations every year in the United States alone. Preclinical research and drug development represent unmet needs in this underestimated subgroup of patients with lung cancer. Gefitinib is effective as first-line therapy for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, after failure of gefitinib, it is unknown whether any second-line regimens could lead to better outcomes. To study the influence of different second-line antitumor regimens on the outcomes of patients with NSCLC after failure of first-line gefitinib, we carried out a retrospective study in a tertiary referral medical center to investigate the prognosis of patients with NSCLC receiving second-line antitumor treatment after gefitinib therapy. Clinical data and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status of tumors were collected. A total of 195 patients with Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC receiving first-line gefitinib and at least 1 subsequent line therapy were identified. A second-line therapy with a platinum-based combination or taxane-containing regimen were associated with a higher therapy response, whereas a platinum-based combination was linked to better overall survival. Ninety-five patients had tumors with known EGFR mutation status; 61 had EGFR mutations and 34 had wild-type EGFR. A second-line therapy with a gemcitabine/platinum combination regimen resulted in better overall survival than erlotinib in patients with EGFR mutations (p = 0.035) but not in patients with wild-type EGFR (p = 0.785). The study suggested that, after failure of first-line gefitinib therapy, second-line platinum-based combination regimens were associated with a better overall survival than other regimens, including erlotinib. The survival benefit of platinum-based combination regimens existed in patients with mutant EGFR but not wild-type EGFR. Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the world, causing more than 1 million deaths annually.1 Unfortunately, most of the patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at advanced stages (Stages IIIb and IV), with an essentially poor prognosis. First-line platinum-based chemotherapy has been documented to improve overall survival and quality of life and is recommended for advanced stage NSCLC.2, 3 However, platinum-based chemotherapy also has the disadvantage of toxic effects,2 and certain patients, such as the elderly, may not be able to tolerate the potential toxicity.4  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane glycoprotein, is involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis of cells. Loss of control of EGFR due to deregulation, amplification or mutations may result in malignant changes of cells.5, 6 Gefitinib (Iressa, AstreZeneca, Wilmington, DE), an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK), has a novel antitumor effect on NSCLC. Effective gefitinib responsiveness is associated with EGFR mutations, as reported in recent studies.7\\u201310 A series of EGFR kinase domain mutations have been discovered in NSCLC, mainly in adenocarcinoma.11\\u201313 The mutations most frequently exist in Exons 18\\u201321, which encompass most of the tyrosine kinase binding domain of EGFR.14 They are substitutions for G719 in the nucleotide-binding loop of Exon 18, in-frame deletions within Exon 19, in-frame duplication and/or insertion in Exon 20 and substitutions for L858 or L861 in the activation loop in Exon 21. As reported in literature, the 2 major EGFR mutations are deletions in Exon 19 and L858R in Exon 21.15 These 2 mutations are the most well-documented mutations with which patients might have an effective response to gefitinib treatment.16  Gefitinib has been useful in patients previously treated by chemotherapy regimens.17 Recently, several studies were conducted to clarify the effectiveness of gefitinib monotherapy as first-line treatment for NSCLC.18\\u201322 It was documented that gefitinib was effective in tumor reduction and improvement of quality of life and was well tolerated in chemona\\u00ffve patients with NSCLC. In the recent Phase III trial including Asian patients who were chemonaive and never or light exsmokers, gefitinib led to superior efficacy, higher quality of life and more favorable tolerability profile compared with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy as first-line treatment.22 Gefitinib can be one of the mainstay first-line treatments for NSCLC in the future. However, once first-line gefitinib has failed after some period of treatment, which succeeding antitumor regimen may lead to better outcomes is unknown. There are several options after first-line gefitinib: platinum-based combination chemotherapy, nonplatinum based chemotherapy or erlotinib, another approved EGFR TK inhibitor.  To clarify whether after failure of first-line gefitinib, the outcomes of patients with NSCLC might be influenced by the choice of second-line antitumor regimens, we performed a retrospective study. The effects of EGFR mutation status on second-line regimens were also analyzed. Material and Methods  Patients  We reviewed all the lung cancer patients diagnosed at the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2004 and July 2008. All patients receiving gefitinib for treating Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC were identified from the records of the Department of Pharmacy in the hospital.  The patients' clinical data, including the demographic information, cell type of cancer, smoking status and image studies were reviewed. Never smokers were defined as those who had smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Date of diagnosis, all chemotherapy received and responsiveness of chemotherapy were recorded. Lung cancer histology was defined according to the World Health Organization pathology classification.23 Tumor specimens obtained by either surgical or needle biopsy/aspiration procedures, including primary lung tumors, malignant effusion cell blocks and other distant metastases, were sequenced for mutational analysis. Written informed consent for use of tissue in molecular analysis was acquired from patients at the procurement of tumor specimens. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital. Antitumor chemotherapy and evaluation of effectiveness  The timing and order of different chemotherapy regimens depended on the physicians' discretion. Gefitinib was taken orally at a dosage of 250 mg daily. Available chemotherapy drugs are platinums (including cisplatin and carboplatin), gemcitabine, taxanes (including docetaxel and paclitaxel), premetrexed, vinorelbine and cetuximab. Erlotinib, if chosen as second-line therapy, was administered 150 mg once daily. Baseline assessments were usually performed within 2 weeks before treatment. Chest radiography was routinely performed and assessed every 2\\u20133 weeks to evaluate response after the start of treatment. A chest computed tomography scan (including liver and adrenal glands) was performed every 2\\u20133 months as routine clinical practice and as needed to confirm the response and progression of disease. Treatment responses were defined as progressive disease, stable disease, partial response and complete response, according to the criteria of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors group.24 Patients with complete response or partial response were regarded as responders and the others as nonresponders to antitumor therapy. The disease control status included complete response, partial response and stable disease. Overall survival was measured from the first day of treatment, of either gefitinib or other antitumor regimens, till the day of death. Progression-free survival was measured from the first day of treatment till the first objective or clinical sign of disease progression. Mutational analysis of EGFR  We retrospectively reviewed the EGFR mutation status of the lung cancer specimens. Tumor specimens, including paraffin blocks or frozen tissues of surgical specimens, fine needle biopsies and pleural effusions were procured for mutational analysis. These formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients screened for EGFR mutations were: (i) those who underwent fine needle biopsies or thoracentesis for pleural effusions after July 2004 when consecutive recruitment for EGFR mutations was started at the hospital, (ii) those whose resected tumors were retrospectively sequenced or (iii) those who were included for retrospective NSCLC studies.25\\u201327 The mutational analysis of EGFR genes has been described previously.25 Briefly, DNA was derived from the tumors embedded in paraffin blocks using a QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR coding sequence, Exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 were amplified, and independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were purified and sequenced in an automatic ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer.  The frozen lung cancer tissues were obtained at surgery, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until use. Total mRNA was extracted from resected cancer tissue using a RNA extraction kit (RNeasy Mini kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The 4 exons (Exons 18-21) that code for the TK domain of the EGFR gene were amplified with primers and PCR conditions as reported.28, 29 RT-PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced.  All sequencing reactions were performed in both forward and reverse directions, using tracings from at least 2 PCRs. Statistical analyses  All categorical variables were analyzed with \\u03c72 tests, except where a small size (<5) required the use of Fisher's exact test. Otherwise, the Student's t-test was conducted for continuous variables for means comparisons between the 2 groups. For multivariate analysis, multiple logistic regression using stepwise method were implemented to select significant variables, which were defined as 0.1 for both the entering and the removing effect in the models. Median overall survivals and progression-free survivals after the first-line gefitinib or the second-line antitumor therapy were estimated by the Kaplan\\u2013Meier method to assess the time to death or progression. The log-rank test was used to compare cumulative survival in different groups, such as responder vs. nonresponder, etc. All reported p values were 2 sided, and a p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 13.0; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Results  Patients receiving first-line gefitinib and more than 1 subsequent antitumor therapy  A total of 939 patients with NSCLC received gefitinib treatment between January 2004 and July 2008. Of these patients, we identified 195 who had received first-line gefitinib and at least 1 subsequent line treatment (66 patients who participated in a prospective first-line gefitinib clinical trial were not included18). After starting first-line gefitinib therapy, the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months with an overall survival of 20.9 months. The response to gefitinib, progression-free survival with gefitinib and overall survival after gefitinib of these 195 patients are listed in Table 1. Ninety-five of the 195 patients had undergone sequencing for EGFR mutations. Sixty-one patients (64.2%) had mutant EGFR and the other 34 had wild-type EGFR. The distribution of different EGFR mutations and response to first-line gefitinib and second-line regimens were listed in Table 2. Patients with mutant EGFR had a better response to gefitinib, longer progression-free survival and overall survival after gefitinib than those bearing wild-type EGFR (Table 3) (Fig. 1).  Figure 1.

Demographic data and treatment outcomes after first-line gefitinib for patients who underwent second-line therapy inline image Comparison of different second-line therapies after first-line gefitinib  In the 195 patients who received first-line gefitinib and at least 1 subsequent line treatment, the second-line regimens included: erlotinib, gemcitabine (with or without platinum), taxane (with or without platinum) and vinorelbine (with or without platinum). Distribution of different second-line regimens and response to second-line regimens stratified by previous gefitinib response and EGRF mutation are listed in Table 1. Twenty-eight (14.4%) patients had a favorable response to a second-line regimen. The taxane/platinum combination regimen had the best response rate (50.0%), whereas erlotinib had the worst response rate (5.6%). An interesting finding was that patients with a previously favorable response to gefitinib had a lower response rate to second-line treatment than those without treatment response to gefitinib (9.3% vs. 19.4%, p = 0.044). Furthermore, patients bearing tumors with EGFR mutations tended to have a lower second-line response rate than those with wild-type EGFR, although not reaching statistical significance (14.8% vs. 26.5%, p = 0.162).  Factors including gender, smoking history, EGFR status and second-line regimens were analyzed for association with response to second-line therapy (Table 4). In univariate analysis, the following 3 factors had a predilection to a better second-line therapy response: nonerlotinib, platinum-based combination and taxane-containing regimen. After multivariate analysis, platinum-based combination (p = 0.015) and taxane-containing (p = 0.048) regimens were independently associated with clinical response to second-line therapy.  Table 4. Predictive factors associated with clinical response to second-line therapy inline image Survival after second-line therapies  The median survival after the start of second-line therapy was 12.2 months. The predictive value of clinical factors, status of EGFR and treatment regimens to survival after second-line therapy were assessed (Table 5). Platinum-based combinations (p = 0.011) were the only factor associated with better overall survival outcomes after the start of second-line therapy.  Table 5. Association between clinical factors and survival after second-line therapy inline image We compared the survivals after different second-line regimens. Patients receiving platinum-based regimens had a longer median survival (21.7 months) than nonplatinum regimens (8.9 months, p = 0.006) and erlotinib (12.2 months, p = 0.090). Patients with a gemcitabine/platinum regimen tended to have a longer median survival (23.0 months) than taxane/platinum (14.0 months), although not reaching statistical significance (p = 0.469). Association between EGFR mutation and second-line therapy  In patients who received erlotinib as the second-line treatment, the response rates were not statistically different between patients with EGFR mutation (n = 20) and those with wild-type EGFR (n = 10) (p = 0.197). Besides, survival after the start of erlotinib did not differ between mutant EGFR and wild-type EGFR (10.0 months vs. 12.7 months, p = 0.477 by the log rank test, Fig. 2a). In those who underwent platinum-based combination regimens, the response rates were not statistically different between patients with EGFR mutation (n = 20) and those with wild-type EGFR (n = 15) (p = 0.313). However, patients with EGFR mutations had a longer survival than patients with wild-type EGFR (24.5 months vs. 8.5 months, p = 0.013 by the log rank test, Fig. 2b).  Figure 2.  Figure 2. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Kaplan\\u2013Meier analysis of overall survival after the start of second-line erlotinib (a) and second-line platinum-based regimens (b). EGFR mutations were associated with a longer survival after the start of second-line treatment with platinum-based regimens (p = 0.013) but not erlotinib (p = 0.477). For patients with EGFR mutations, the gemcitabine-platinum combination regimen (n = 16) as second-line therapy achieved a longer survival than second-line erlotinib therapy (n = 20) (27.1 months vs. 10 months, p = 0.035 by the log rank test, Fig. 3a), whereas in the patients with wild-type EGFR, the difference between second-line gemcitabine-platinum combination (n = 10) and erlotinib (n = 10) was not significant (10.1 months vs. 12.7 months, p = 0.785 by the log rank test, Fig. 3b).  Figure 3.  Figure 3. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Kaplan\\u2013Meier analysis of overall survival after the start of second-line therapy in patients with EGFR mutations (a) and wild-type EGFR (b). The gemcitabine/platinum combination regimen resulted in a better survival after the start of second-line therapy than erlotinib in patients with EGFR mutations (p = 0.035) but not wild-type EGFR (p = 0.785). Discussion  In this study, we included 195 patients with NSCLC who received first-line gefitinib and at least 1 succeeding antitumor treatment, including erlotinib and several regimens of chemotherapy. Outcomes of the patients receiving different second-line therapies were compared, and the effects of EGFR mutations were analyzed. The total response rate of these second-line therapies was 14.4%, and the median overall survival after start of second-line treatments was 12.2 months. We found that platinum-based combinations and taxane-containing regimens were both predictors of second-line therapy response and platinum-based combination regimens lead to a better survival after failure of first line gefitinib. In the total population, the status of EGFR mutation did not influence outcomes of second-line therapies. However, in the subgroup of patients with EGFR mutations, the gemcitabine-platinum combination resulted in a better survival than erlotinib as a second-line therapy after first-line gefitinib.  In many recently published studies, it has been documented that fist-line gefitinib therapy may result in favorable outcomes and tolerance, especially in Asian populations and in patients with EGFR mutations.18\\u201322 However, it is not known which regimen after the failure of first-line gefitinib could result in better survival outcomes. Some clinical trials have designed second-line regimens after first-line gefitinib,30 but comparisons between different regimens were not studied. In addition, effects of EGFR mutations on these second-line therapies after gefitinib were not discussed. In the well-designed study conducted by D'Addario et al.,30 41 patients underwent second-line chemotherapy after discontinuation of first-line gefitinib. The response rate was 34.1% and progression-free survival after second-line chemotherapy was 6.8 months. All the patients received a gemcitabine/cisplatin combination regimen in that study, but no other regimens were applied nor was overall survival after chemotherapy reported in the published document.  The results from our study revealed that platinum-based combinations resulted in better overall survival than single chemotherapy or erlotinib. In current practice, a platinum-based regimen is the standard first-line therapy with a response rate of 20\\u201330%.2 In our study, platinum-based combination regimens, as second-line therapy after first-line gefitinib, provided more favorable overall survival than other regimens, with a response rate of 27%. Despite initial responses to gefitinib or erlotinib, most patients ultimately have treatment failure. The majority of the mechanisms of failure of these TK inhibitors result from an acquired EGFR mutation T790M or amplification of the MET oncogene.31\\u201333 It seems that the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy was not influenced by failure of gefitinib in our study. The indications and timing of using platinum-based combination regimens as second-line chemotherapy after gefitinib failure could be the same as in first-line therapy. Although this is not a prospective study, our observation strongly suggests that platinum-based combination should be used after first-line gefitinib if there is no obvious contraindication.  On the contrary, erlotinib used after gefitinib failure did not perform, and it was used without previous exposure of gefitinib.34, 35 The cross resistance due to acquired EGFR mutation T790M or amplification of the MET oncogene may explain the failure of erlotinib use after development of resistance of gefitinib. In our study, the response rate for second-line erlotinib was 5.6%. A similar result was reported in the study by Lee et al.35 In Lee's Phase II clinical trial, 23 patients received erlotinib after failure of gefitinib, but gefitinib was not the first-line therapy in all of the patients in Lee's study. The response rate of erlotinib after gefitinib was only 4.3%. In that study, it was suggested that erlotinib should not be given routinely after failure of gefitinib treatment except in the highly selected group who had benefited from previous gefitinib treatment. The poor response rate can be explained by the identical pharmacological effect of gefitinib and erlotinib. However, there are still some patients getting benefits from second-line erlotinib after gefitinib though the mechanisms are not fully understood.36\\u201338  In our study population with a first-line gefitinib response rate of 63.9%, 95 of all 195 patients had been screened for EGFR mutations, with 61 patients (64.2%) having EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are more prevalent in female East Asians with nonsmoking status and adenocarcinoma histology. These clinical factors of EGFR mutations, including high-gefitinib response, are comparable with the many other studies performed in this region.39, 40 However, rather little information has been reported regarding EGFR mutations and clinical outcomes after chemotherapy. In a Phase III clinical trial, for patients receiving first-line carboplatin plus paclitaxel therapy, regardless of with or without erlotinib, the overall survival was longer in the EGFR mutation group than in wild-type EGFR.41 In our study group, who were pretreated with gefitinib, second-line platinum-based combination regimens resulted in better overall survival in mutant EGFR patients than in wild-type EGFR patients. Although generated from a retrospective study design, our finding echoes previous observations from prospective clinical trials and is worth attention because of the possible clinical implications.  The study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective study with selected groups of patients. Second, use of gefitinib as first-line treatment and selection of second-line therapy depended on the clinical decisions of physicians caring for the patients. Selection bias might exist in these decisions, and the bias could influence the survival after second-line therapy. Third, the cell types of our study group were predominantly adenocarcinoma. The clinical effects of second-line therapies with other cell types should be discussed in further studies. Another limitation is the relatively small population of our study. A larger patient population and a prospective study are mandatory for adaptation of our findings to clinical practice.  In conclusion, after failure of first-line gefitinib, platinum-based combinations and taxane-containing regimens were both predictive factors for second-line therapy response. Platinum-based combination regimens resulted in better overall survival than a single agent chemotherapy or erlotinib. The effects of EGFR mutations were not obvious on second-line erlotinib after first-line gefitinib.  NTRODUCTION Non\\u2013small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) continue to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths (1). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations were initially reported in 2004 and defined a prevalent molecularly classified subgroup of NSCLC (2\\u20137). The most common EGFR mutations are in-frame deletions around the LREA motif (amino acid residues 747 to 750) of exon 19 (45% of EGFR mutations) and the exon 21 L858R point mutation (40% of EGFR mutations) (5, 6, 8). These EGFR mutations are oncogenic in both cell lines and mouse models (9, 10). They activate the EGFR signaling pathway in the absence of ligand, promote downstream prosurvival and antiapoptotic signals such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal\\u2013regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and render EGFR-mutated cells dependent on constitutively active EGFR for their survival (11, 12). The inhibition of EGFR up-regulates proapoptotic molecules (such as BIM) in models driven by EGFR-delE746_A750 or L858R, activates the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and ultimately leads to cell death (13\\u201316). Most patients whose tumors harbor exon 19 deletions or L858R EGFR-activating mutations have radiographic responses to monotherapy with the reversible adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\\u2013competitive EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib (17\\u201323) and the irreversible EGFR TKI afatinib (24). Other EGFR mutations have also been associated with some sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib. These include exon 18 point mutations in position G719 (G719A, G719C, or G719S; ~3% of EGFR mutations), rare in-frame exon 19 insertions (25), and the exon 21 L861Q mutant (~2% of EGFR mutations) (26\\u201328).  The other main group of EGFR mutations in NSCLC is composed of in-frame insertions within exon 20 of EGFR (Fig. 1A). Exon 20 insertion mutations comprise 4 to 10% of all EGFR mutations (27, 29\\u201332). Most of these mutations lie near the end of the C helix within the N lobe of the kinase, after residue M766, but a small subset map to the middle of the C helix (affecting amino acids E762 to Y764) (5, 33, 34). Unlike EGFR exon 19 deletions and L858R-bearing tumors, most NSCLCs with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations do not respond radiographically or clinically to gefitinib or erlotinib. The reported response rate (RR) is less than 5%, and most patients have short intervals of disease control (35). The precise mechanisms that determine the primary insensitivity to EGFR TKIs in the most prevalent exon 20 insertion mutations and the response of less prevalent exon 20 insertion mutations to gefitinib or erlotinib remain elusive. We herein elucidate the molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie the patterns of response or resistance of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations to EGFR TKIs.

Immunoblotting was done against the indicated proteins [EGFR, AKT, and ERK, as well as full-length poly(adenosine diphosphate\\u2013ribose) polymerase (flPARP) or cleaved PARP (clPARP) and isoforms of BIM (extra long, BIMEL; long, BIML; and short, BIMS)].  RESULTS Sensitivity of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations to EGFR TKIs in vitro To better understand the patterns of resistance or response to EGFR TKIs of exon 20 insertion mutations, we studied representative EGFR exon 20 mutations using in vitro systems. We selected two mutations that lie within the C helix [A763_Y764insFQEA (structurally identical to D761_E762insEAFQ) and Y764_V765insHH] and five mutations that lie at the end of the helix or within the loop following it [M766_A767insAI, A767_V769dupASV (identical to V769_D770insASV), D770_N771insNPG, D770_N771insSVD (identical to S768_D770dupSVD), and H773_V774insH (identical to P772_H773insH)] (Fig. 1A and table S1). In aggregate, these mutations represent more than half of reported EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (31, 32, 35). In addition, we used gefitinib/erlotinib-sensitive [L858R and exon 19 deletion mutations (delL747_S752 and delL747_P753insS)] and gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant (L858R + T790M and exon 19 deletion mutations + T790M) mutations as assay controls (36, 37).  We created Ba/F3 cells stably expressing the aforementioned EGFR mutations. All were able to proliferate in the absence of interleukin-3 (fig. S1), indicating transforming ability of these mutations. We next measured proliferation in the presence of erlotinib and showed that only cells with EGFR-delL747_P753insS, L858R, and the atypical A763_Y764insFQEA\\u2014among all EGFR exon 20 insertions\\u2014were inhibited by erlotinib concentrations less than 0.1 \\u03bcM (Fig. 1, B and C, and table S2). All other EGFR exon 20 insertions and T790M-bearing mutations had 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) that exceeded 2 \\u03bcM erlotinib (Fig. 1, B and C, and table S2). Nearly identical results were obtained with gefitinib (table S2), and a similar pattern of insensitivity was noted with the more potent irreversible EGFR TKI afatinib (table S2). Transient transfection and overexpression of these EGFR constructs in Cos-7 cells led to comparable results (fig. S2). Examination of EGFR signaling revealed that phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK was not fully inhibited by 1 \\u03bcM erlotinib in cells with the inhibitor-insensitive EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (Fig. 1D). A dose-response experiment disclosed that an inhibitor-insensitive EGFR exon 20 insertion (A767_V769dupASV) lacked deactivation of phosphorylated EGFR, downstream targets (PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK), and up-regulation of the apoptotic cascade, as measured by levels of BIM [a marker of EGFR TKI-induced cell killing (13)], with 1 \\u03bcM or submicromolar concentrations of erlotinib (Fig. 1E). In stark contrast, the inhibition of these downstream phosphorylation events and up-regulation of BIM were seen with EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA in a similar fashion as with inhibitor-sensitive L858R (Fig. 1, D and E). Enzyme kinetic analysis of representative EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants On the basis of our cell line studies, we selected a representative inhibitor-resistant exon 20 insertion mutant, D770_N771insNPG, and the inhibitor-sensitive A763_Y764insFQEA for detailed enzyme kinetic studies. We expressed and purified the kinase domain of these mutants (residues 696 to 1022 of EGFR) and of the L858R mutant and wild-type EGFR. Consistent with their transforming activity (fig. S1), both insertion mutants exhibited higher catalytic activity than wild-type EGFR, although they were not as active as EGFR-L858R (Table 1).  Table 1. Enzyme kinetic parameters of wild-type (WT) and mutant EGFR kinases. All experiments were performed in triplicate (n = 3). Km[ATP], Michaelis constant for ATP; Ki, inhibition constant; SD, standard deviation.  View this table: View popup View inline The exquisite sensitivity of EGFR-L858R and exon 19 deletions to EGFR TKIs stems from two effects: their enhanced intrinsic affinity for these TKIs and their markedly decreased affinity for substrate ATP (38, 39). Thus, we measured the Michaelis constant for ATP (Km[ATP]) for D770_N771insNPG and A763_Y764insFQEA (Table 1 and fig. S3), as well as the inhibition constant (Ki) for gefitinib for these mutants (Table 1 and fig. S4). Notably, the inhibitor-sensitive A763_Y764insFQEA mutant bound gefitinib ~10-fold more tightly than the insensitive D770_N771insNPG mutant (Table 1). The D770_N771insNPG mutant bound gefitinib with a Ki similar to that of wild-type EGFR (Ki = 25.7 nM for D770_N771insNPG and Ki = 16.4 nM for wild-type EGFR). The Ki value for A763_Y764insFQEA (2.5 nM) was comparable to that we measured for the L858R mutant (6.4 nM). Because inhibitors must compete with substrate ATP for binding, the ratio of Ki/Km[ATP] provides a better estimate of potency than the Ki alone. On the basis of this measure, A763_Y764insFQEA is predicted to be almost as sensitive to gefitinib as the L858R mutant, whereas D770_N771insNPG is expected to be many fold less sensitive (Table 1). The practical effect of these alterations in kinetic parameters can be seen in inhibition curves measured at a range of ATP concentrations; like L858R, the A763_Y764insFQEA mutant is effectively inhibited by gefitinib in the presence of 1 mM ATP (which approximates the concentration of ATP in cells), whereas D770_N771insNPG is not (fig. S4). EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and response to reversible EGFR inhibitors in patients with NSCLC To determine whether clinical responses matched the pattern of sensitivity to EGFR TKIs that we observed in vitro, we assembled data from 19 NSCLC patients with diverse EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who were treated with reversible EGFR TKIs (Fig. 2, A and B, and table S3).

Yellow bars, partial response (PR); blue bars, stable disease (SD); red bars, progressive disease (PD). Asterisk indicates patients who displayed nonmeasurable progressive disease. (B) Detailed response of each individual mutation type analyzed.  Consistent with previous reports (35, 40\\u201344), almost all 19 NSCLC patients from our centers displayed progressive disease in the course of treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib (Fig. 2B, table S3, and fig. S5). However, three patients with A763_Y764insFQEA EGFR-mutated NSCLCs achieved either stable disease or partial response when treated with erlotinib (Fig. 2, A and B, fig. S5, and table S3). Even in this small case series, the RR of gefitinib or erlotinib was significantly higher for A763_Y764insFQEA (2 of 3, 66.6%) when compared to all other mutations within or following the C helix (0 of 16, 0%; P = 0.0175); furthermore, the progression-free survival of these patients exceed that of patients with other exon 20 mutations (fig. S6). Thus, as predicted by our preclinical studies, NSCLCs harboring EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA appear to respond to gefitinib and erlotinib. Characterization of an A763_Y764insFQEA mutated lung cancer cell line To further study the properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA insertion, we derived a lung cell line from the malignant pleural effusion of a patient with an NSCLC containing EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA (Fig. 3A, table S3, and fig. S5). The original biopsy disclosed an adenocarcinoma (fig. S7), and the derived cell line (named BID007) was adherent to the tissue culture plates (fig. S8). Sequence of exons 18 to 21 of EGFR from DNA isolated from BID007 confirmed the presence of the 12 nucleotides corresponding to the A763_Y764insFQEA insertion (Fig. 3A). DNA was also analyzed for additional hotspot mutations in 113 known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (table S4), and no additional mutation was identified. A detailed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis to determine copy number variations in BID007\\u2019s DNA showed that many regions of the cells\\u2019 chromosomes had broad and focal copy gains or losses (fig. S9A). The region around chromosome 7, corresponding to EGFR, demonstrated slight amplification (fig. S9B). In addition, BID007 had a focal area of deletion encompassing the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene (fig. S9C), an area commonly deleted in cancers (45).

(B) Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of EGFR in NSCLC cell lines A549, BID007, and H3255 cells for 72 hours (n = 3). EGFR protein was detected by immunoblotting. Compared to A549 cells, siRNA1 and siRNA2 inhibited proliferation in BID007 (P = 0.005 and P = 0.001, respectively) and H3255 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.003, respectively). (C) Dose-dependent cell growth inhibition of H3255, BID007, HCC827, H1975, and PC9 cells. The cells were treated with the indicated doses of erlotinib for 72 hours. Error bars indicate SD (n = 3). Calculated average IC50 values of H3255, BID007, HCC827, H1975, and PC9 cells are shown (n = 3). (D) Inhibition of EGFR signaling by erlotinib in NSCLC cell lines. PC9, HCC827, H3255, BID007, and H1975 cells were treated with or without 1 \\u03bcM erlotinib for 6 hours. Phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK proteins was detected by immunoblotting. (E) Dose response of erlotinib in BID007, H3255, and H1975 cells. The cells were treated with indicated doses of erlotinib for 24 hours. Immunoblotting was done against the indicated proteins (EGFR, AKT, ERK, clPARP, and BIM).  To determine whether BID007 requires mutant EGFR for its viability, we used siRNAs against EGFR in BID007, as well as in lung cancer cell lines H3255 (EGFR-L858R and known to undergo cell proliferation arrest and cell death upon inactivation of EGFR) and A549 (KRAS-mutated). In both BID007 and H3255, EGFR-specific siRNAs decreased expression of EGFR and suppressed cell growth (Fig. 3B). As expected, EGFR siRNAs had no effect on the growth of KRAS-mutated A549 cells (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that BID007 cells, similar to other EGFR-mutated cell lines, are dependent on aberrant EGFR signaling.  The sensitivity of BID007 cells to EGFR TKIs was compared to that of a group of three EGFR TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutated NSCLC lines [PC9 (EGFR-delE746_A750), HCC827 (delE746_A750), and H3255] and one erlotinib-resistant line [H1975 (L858R + T790M)]. Proliferation assays with increasing concentrations of EGFR TKIs disclosed that growth of BID007, PC9, HCC827, and H3255 cells was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of erlotinib (Fig. 3C and table S2), gefitinib, and afatinib (table S2), indicating augmented sensitivity relative to the inhibitor-resistant H1975 cell line.  The levels of phosphorylated EGFR, AKT, and ERK in BID007, PC9, HCC827, and H3255 were diminished by 1 \\u03bcM erlotinib (Fig. 3D). A dose-response experiment highlighted that only BID007 and H3255 had deactivation of phosphorylated EGFR, AKT, and ERK and up-regulation of BIM with submicromolar concentrations of erlotinib (Fig. 3E), and underwent apoptosis with submicromolar doses of erlotinib, as shown by PARP cleavage (Fig. 3E). These results supported our siRNA experiments and further detailed that BID007 cells were not only dependent on EGFR signaling but also sensitive to clinically achievable submicromolar concentrations of gefitinib and erlotinib. Structural analysis of EGFR TKI-resistant and TKI-sensitive EGFR exon 20 mutants To better understand the mechanism of activation of TKI-resistant EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, we determined the structure of D770_N771insNPG in complex with the inhibitor PD168393 at 3.5-\\u00c5 resolution (table S5). For comparison, we also determined the structure of EGFR-L858R in complex with the same compound (table S5). PD168393 is a preclinical irreversible anilinoquinazoline inhibitor that is structurally related to afatinib and dacomitinib (46, 47). Preparation of a covalent complex with PD168393 stabilized the protein during final stages of purification and was required for crystallization. The D770_N771insNPG mutant adopts an active conformation with the C helix in its inward position (Fig. 4A). The structure contains five molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit arranged in a continuous chain of \\u201casymmetric dimer\\u201d interactions in which the C lobe of one molecule interacts with the N lobe of the next (fig. S10A). This mode of interaction mediates EGFR activation by ligand-induced dimerization (48), and is typically recapitulated in crystals of the EGFR kinase in its active conformation. The D770_N771insNPG insertion lies at the C-terminal end of the C helix, immediately following D770 (Fig. 4A). Together with D770, the three inserted residues form a tight turn, with a hydrogen bond formed between the main-chain carbonyl of D770 and the amide of the inserted glycine (Fig. 4B and fig. S10, B and C). Beyond this glycine, the conformation of the polypeptide chain is quite similar to that of the wild-type and L858R kinases (38), and overall, the D770_N771insNPG structure superimposes well with the L858R structure in complex with the same inhibitor (Fig. 4, B and C). Differences, which likely arise from the divergent crystal packing in D770_N771insNPG, include a small change in the relative orientation of the N and C lobes, and the conformation of the activation loop, which is fully ordered in the D770_N771insNPG structure but not in the present L858R structure. Within the ATP site, the conformation of the covalently bound inhibitor is essentially the same as in the L858R structure, and although the resolution of this study is relatively low (3.5 \\u00c5), there is no evidence that the D770_N771insNPG mutation alters interactions with the inhibitor (Fig. 4C). Likewise, we expect that binding of gefitinib and erlotinib would be unperturbed in this mutant, consistent with the closely similar Ki values for gefitinib we measure for D770_N771insNPG and wild-type EGFR (Table 1).

The inserted NPG sequence is highlighted in magenta. (B) Detailed view of the NPG insertion. The insNPG structure is shown in yellow with the inserted residues in magenta in stick form and is superimposed on the L858R structure (blue ribbon). (C) Superposition of the active-site region of the insNPG and L858R mutants bound to the inhibitor PD168393. The compound binds in an essentially identical manner in both structures, forming a covalent bond with C797.  D770_N771insNPG may activate EGFR by blocking the conformational rearrangements required for the inactive conformation of the kinase. In the inactive state, the C helix pivots outward and shifts by ~3.5 \\u00c5 toward the insertion site. The insertion is at the \\u201cpivot point\\u201d of the C helix; thus, the inserted residues may sterically inhibit the reorientation of the C helix that is characteristic of the inactive state. This mutation may also interfere with an adjacent \\u201celectrostatic switch\\u201d interaction that is proposed to stabilize an inactive EGFR dimer (49). Irrespective of the detailed mechanism of activation, our structure and kinetic data show that D770_N771insNPG promotes the active conformation, as reflected by its enhanced catalytic activity (Table 1) and a propensity to form the asymmetric dimer as seen in the crystal structure (fig. S10A) and in solution (fig. S11).  Because we have been unable to crystallize the A763_Y764insFQEA mutant EGFR, we studied it further using homology modeling. The four-residue FQEA insertion occurs just C terminal to A763, in the middle of the C helix. From a structural perspective, the four inserted residues are expected to form about one turn of helix and shift the register of adjacent residues in the helix, either toward the N terminus or toward the C terminus (Fig. 5A). The C helix contains a key active-site residue, E762, just N terminal to the site of the insertion (50). A shift in register toward the C terminus would leave this catalytically important residue unaltered. Alternatively, a shift toward the N terminus would displace this residue by one turn, but effectively replace it with a glutamic acid residue introduced by the insertion (FQEA, Fig. 5A). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we prepared two altered versions of this mutant: one in which the endogenous E762 is mutated to glutamine (E762Q_insFQEA) and a second in which the inserted glutamic acid residue is mutated to glutamine (A763_Y764insFQQA). We found that E762Q_insFQEA, like A763_Y764insFQEA, was highly active in a ligand-independent manner, but A763_Y764insFQQA was inactive (Fig. 5B). Thus, we conclude that the insertion shifts the register of the helix in the N-terminal direction and that the glutamic acid residue in the FQEA insertion assumes the active-site role of E762 in the wild-type kinase. On the basis of these findings, we prepared homology models of the A763_Y764insFQEA mutant using both the active and inactive conformations of the kinase (Fig. 5, C and D). In both models, the insertion was modeled in a helical conformation, shifting the register of the C helix toward its N terminus, and resulting in a longer loop at its N-terminal end (the \\u03b23-\\u03b1C loop). Examination of the homology model of the inactive state suggests a mechanism of activation related to that of L858R (38). The shift in register in the C helix effectively replaces I759 with alanine (Fig. 5D). Isoleucine at position 759, together with L747, L858, and L861, is part of a cluster of interacting hydrophobic residues that helps to stabilize the inactive conformation. The L858R and L861Q mutations within this cluster are well-characterized activating mutations (28), and mutation of L747 in this cluster to proline or serine is believed to underlie the activity of EGFR exon 19 insertions (25). Thus, we hypothesize that the de facto I759A replacement caused by the FQEA insertion may activate EGFR via a similar mechanism (destabilization of the inactive conformation). Furthermore, we note that like both exon 19 deletion and insertion mutants (25), A763_Y764insFQEA must alter the structure of the \\u03b23-\\u03b1C loop. The model based on the active state supports the hypothesis that the glutamic acid residue in the A763_Y764insFQEA insertion can effectively replace E762 in the active site (Fig. 4, A and C). Finally, inspection of the model indicates that the FQEA insertion is compatible with formation of the asymmetric dimer, and, consistent with this, analysis of the A763_Y764insFQEA mutant using size-exclusion chromatography revealed a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution (fig. S11).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 5. Homology modeling of the TKI-sensitive EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA mutation (insFQEA). (A) Two plausible alignments of the wild-type and insFQEA sequences in the region of the C helix. The inserted FQEA residues (bold) could shift the register of the C helix in the C-terminal direction (upper panel) or in the N-terminal direction (lower panel) and maintain a glutamic acid in the position of Glu762, a key active-site residue. A C-terminal shift would be expected to lengthen the loop following the C helix (\\u03b1C-\\u03b24), whereas an N-terminal shift would lengthen the loop preceding it (\\u03b23-\\u03b1C). The region that would be altered relative to wild type is boxed in orange (lower panel). (B) EGFR mutant constructs introduced into Cos-7 cells. EGFR phosphorylation and the presence of transfected constructs [as measured by hemagglutinin (HA) tag levels] are depicted. Four different constructs\\u2014insFQEA, insFQQA (E\\u2192Q mutation in the inserted sequence), E762Q_insFQEA (E\\u2192Q mutation in the endogenous E762), and L858R + T790M\\u2014were transiently transfected into Cos-7 cells. Phosphorylation of EGFR and HA tag was detected by immunoblotting. Mutagenesis of the respective glutamic acid residues indicates a shift in the N-terminal direction. (C) Homology model of the insFQEA mutant (yellow) superimposed on the wild-type EGFR structure (blue ribbon) in the active conformation. The inserted residues are labeled in bold, and the shifted sequence is colored orange [corresponding to the boxed region in (A)]; the glutamic acid residue in the FQEA insertion assumes the position of E762 and is positioned to form a salt bridge with K745. (D) Homology model of the insFQEA mutant in the inactive conformation (yellow, with the structurally altered region in orange) superimposed on the wild-type EGFR structure in the inactive conformation (drawn from PDB ID: 1XKK). A cluster of hydrophobic residues (yellow side chains) is important for the stability of the inactive state; L858 and L861 are part of this cluster. The insFQEA insertion will shift an alanine residue into the position of I759 in this cluster (I759>A). The insertion is also expected to alter the length and conformation of the \\u03b23-\\u03b1C loop, which is the site of exon 19 deletion mutations.  DISCUSSION EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations comprise a unique set of EGFR-activating mutations. These have been previously described as insensitive to clinically available reversible EGFR TKIs, gefitinib and erlotinib (31, 32, 35, 51). In the present report, we provide detailed characterization of a broad spectrum of these mutations and their correlation with patient response to EGFR TKIs. Our study was limited by a number of factors, including a paucity of available NSCLC cell lines with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, a lack of in vivo models, and the small number of exon 20 insertion\\u2013mutated NSCLC cases that were treated with reversible EGFR TKIs in our centers. Within these constraints, our data confirm that most exon 20 insertions are not inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of reversible EGFR TKIs. The most common EGFR exon 20 insertions that have been reported in NSCLC samples are post\\u2013C helix insertions of one to four amino acids, which, in aggregate, account for 80 to 90% of all exon 20 insertions (31, 32, 35). We characterized Y764_V765insHH, M766_A767insAI, A767_V769dupASV, D770_N771insNPG, D770_N771insSVD, and H773_V774insH using in vitro models and found that cells bearing these mutant EGFR proteins are not inhibited by clinically achievable doses of gefitinib, erlotinib (12, 35, 52\\u201354), or the irreversible EGFR inhibitor afatinib (35, 55). These results are consistent with our observations that tumors harboring these mutations did not achieve clinical or radiographic responses to usual doses of gefitinib (250 mg/day) or erlotinib (150 mg/day) in NSCLC patients. Therefore, on the basis of our data and previously published reports (31, 32, 35), the aforementioned mutations affecting amino acids Y764 to V774 should be classified as nonsensitizing to the reversible EGFR TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib.  Unexpectedly, we identified an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation that was inhibited by gefitinib and erlotinib at submicromolar concentrations: EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA. This sequence alteration accounts for 10 to 20% of all reported EGFR exon 20 insertions (31, 32, 35). Our kinetic characterization of this mutant revealed that it is activated, relative to wild-type EGFR, and that it is much more potently inhibited by gefitinib than is wild-type EGFR. In vitro characterization of A763_Y764insFQEA demonstrated that it had an IC50 of <0.05 \\u03bcM to erlotinib or gefitinib, which is more than 10-fold lower than the clinically achievable serum concentrations of these EGFR TKIs [gefitinib (250 mg/day) has serum troughs of ~0.5 \\u03bcM, and erlotinib (100 to 150 mg/day) has serum troughs of ~1 to 2 \\u03bcM] at their clinical dosing schemes (12, 52). In addition, submicromolar concentrations of erlotinib inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR in A763_Y764insFQEA mutant cells, led to deactivation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, and subsequently induced apoptosis in our models. These results were also confirmed in BID007, an NSCLC-derived cell line bearing the EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA mutation. Three patients with NSCLCs harboring EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA had clinical and radiographic regressions or stable disease on erlotinib (150 mg/day). Consequently, we conclude that EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA is an EGFR TKI-sensitizing mutation. Structurally, EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA is very different from other exon 20 insertions. Notwithstanding the limitations inherent in homology modeling, our structural analysis and supporting mutagenesis indicate that the inserted FQEA sequence shifts the register of the C helix toward its N terminus, altering the length of the \\u03b23-\\u03b1C loop, leading into the helix, and effectively leading to an I759A replacement. The \\u03b23-\\u03b1C loop is the site of exon 19 deletion mutations, and the I759A alteration is immediately adjacent to L858R and L861Q, and we hypothesize that it leads to catalytic activation in a related manner. Thus, at a structural and enzyme kinetic level, A763_Y764insFQEA may more closely resemble the L858R and exon 19 deletion mutants than it does other exon 20 insertion mutations. EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA and the identical D761_E762insEAFQ amino acid sequence appear to be unique among reported EGFR exon 20 insertions in having the ability to induce an N-terminal shift in the C helix while maintaining or replacing active-site residue E762.  The structure of D770_N771insNPG, which we studied as a representative EGFR TKI-insensitive exon 20 mutation, shows how the three\\u2013amino acid insertion forms a \\u201cwedge\\u201d at the end of the C helix that may effectively lock the helix in its inward, active position. Although each will differ in detail, we expect that other EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants that insert one to three residues at or near the end of the C helix will have a similar structural effect. The D770_N771insNPG structure, together with our enzyme kinetic studies, shows that this insertion mutant binds EGFR TKIs with a binding mode and apparent affinity similar to that of wild-type EGFR. Thus, the clinical resistance of this mutant does not stem from steric interference with inhibitor binding. Rather, D770_N771insNPG simply does not sensitize to gefitinib and erlotinib inhibition. L858R and exon 19 deletion mutants exhibit increased Km[ATP] and higher affinity (5- to 10-fold) for gefitinib or erlotinib than does the wild-type receptor (39, 50, 56). Together with the oncogene-addicted state of tumors bearing these mutations (39, 50, 56), these factors explain their sensitivity to EGFR TKIs (50). Because the dose-limiting toxicities of gefitinib and erlotinib arise from inhibition of wild-type EGFR in normal tissues, the enhanced sensitivity of these mutants relative to wild-type EGFR effectively creates the \\u201ctherapeutic window\\u201d that makes gefitinib and erlotinib useful drugs (39, 50, 56). In these sensitive EGFR mutants, serum concentrations can be achieved that functionally shut down the oncogenic mutant EGFR, but relatively spare the wild-type receptor in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Unlike EGFR-L858R and exon 19 deletion mutants, the D770_N771insNPG mutation lacks this \\u201cAchilles\\u2019 heel,\\u201d because it activates EGFR without markedly diminishing its affinity for ATP or increasing its affinity for EGFR TKIs.  Our findings have important implications for efforts to develop EGFR TKIs effective against D770_N771insNPG and other \\u201cinsensitive\\u201d exon 20 insertion mutants. The EGFR-T790M mutation confers resistance by reversing the sensitization conferred by primary activating mutations, but it does so by altering the gatekeeper residue in the ATP site that is an important determinant of inhibitor specificity (50, 57). Thus, the T790M structural alteration in essence \\u201cenabled\\u201d discovery of inhibitors that selectively inhibit T790M-bearing mutants, when in association with L858R or exon 19 deletions, relative to wild-type EGFR (58, 59). By contrast, there are no structural alterations proximate to the ATP-binding cleft in D770_N771insNPG. Additionally, the similar ATP- and TKI-binding properties of this mutant, compared with wild-type EGFR, suggest that it will be difficult to achieve the requisite selectivity versus the wild-type receptor (39, 50, 56, 58, 59). Indeed, it seems that EGFR monoclonal antibodies (60) and EGFR wild-type kinase\\u2013sparing covalent T790M selective TKIs (61) are ineffective in typical EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants. Biochemical screening of large compound libraries to identify potent inhibitors of the D770_N771insNPG mutant, with counterscreening against wild-type EGFR to identify mutant-selective compounds or scaffolds, may be the most rational approach to what appears to be a very challenging drug discovery problem. The close homology of EGFR and ERBB2 insertion mutations (46, 62) may indicate that future therapeutic options for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations may also be applicable to other cohorts of NSCLC.  In summary, our results not only explain the intricate interplay between different EGFR mutations and their response to EGFR TKIs but also provide guidance for the selection (in the case of A763_Y764insFQEA) or omission (in the case of other exon 20 insertion mutations) of clinically available TKIs for the treatment of EGFR exon 20 insertion\\u2013mutated NSCLCs.  Summary Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. The identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) somatic mutations defined a new, molecularly classified subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Classic EGFR activating mutations, such as inframe deletions in exon 19 or the Leu858Arg (L858R) point mutation in exon 21 are associated with sensitivity to first generation quinazoline reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are typically located after the C-helix of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, may account for up to 4% of all EGFR mutations. Preclinical models have shown that the most prevalent EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated proteins are resistant to clinically achievable doses of reversible (gefitinib, erlotinib) and irreversible (neratinib, afatinib, PF00299804) EGFR TKIs. Growing clinical experience with patients whose tumours harbour EGFR exon 20 insertions corresponds with the preclinical data; very few patients have had responses to EGFR TKIs. Despite the prevalence and biological importance of EGFR exon 20 insertions, few reports have summarised all preclinical and clinical data on these mutations. Here, we review the literature and provide an update with an emphasis on the structural, molecular, and clinical implications of EGFR exon 20 insertions.  Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with more than 1\\u00b76 million cases diagnosed and 1\\u00b73 million deaths per year.1 Therefore, even small subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) contribute to significant morbidity and mortality.  In 2004, the identification of somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) provided a glimpse into a clinically relevant oncogene and a new molecularly classified subgroup of NSCLC.2; 3 ;  4 Among the multitude of mutations found in the EGFR gene ( figure 1), the most common cluster in two regions and are often termed classic activating mutations. These include inframe deletions around the LeuArgGluAla motif (residues 746\\u2013750) of exon 19 (roughly 45\\u201350% of all EGFR mutations), and the Leu858Arg (L858R) point mutation in exon 21 (about 40\\u201345% of EGFR mutations). 5; 6 ;  7 Classic EGFR mutations are more common in tumours in women, Asians, never smokers, and those with adenocarcinoma histology. 5; 7 ;  8 About 15% of all NSCLCs in western Europeans, 30% in East Asians, and 50% in never smokers are EGFR mutation-positive. 5; 7 ;  8 Most patients with exon 19 deletions or Leu858Arg EGFR activating mutations have substantial clinical and radiographic responses to monotherapy with the reversible anilinoquinazoline, ATP-mimetic EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib. 9 Response rates (RRs) exceed 70%, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of longer than 9 months and overall survival (OS) that reaches 24 months. 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16 ;  17 At least three randomised phase 3 trials have shown a better RR and PFS with gefitinib or erlotinib compared with chemotherapy in patients with classic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. 18; 19; 20 ;  21 Additional EGFR mutations ( figure 1) have been associated with some sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib, although their ability to predict a radiographic and clinical response to gefitinib or erlotinib is less striking than that of classic EGFR mutations. 22 These include point mutations in position Gly719 of exon 18 (Gly719Ala, Cys, or Ser), which account for about 3% of EGFR mutations, and a recurrent Leu861Gln mutation in exon 21 that represents about 2% of EGFR mutations. 23 ;  24 The frequency of classic EGFR mutations in patients with different ethnic backgrounds has not been completely established; however, EGFR genotyping of large prospective cohorts of western Europeans with NSCLC shows a higher frequency of exon 19 deletions than Leu858Arg mutations, 11 compared with similar cohorts or clinical trials of east Asian populations where exon 19 deletions are only slightly more prevalent than Leu858Arg mutations.18  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations(A) Exon structure of EGFR and ...

Figure options Some EGFR mutations are not often associated with radiographic responses and clinical benefit with reversible EGFR TKIs. This is the case for most exon 20 EGFR insertions reported so far. 25; 26 ;  27 Exon 20 insertion mutations might account for up to 4% of all EGFR mutations, 22; 24 ;  28 and therefore as many as 10\\u2008000 new yearly cases of NSCLC worldwide.1 The latter estimate is based on data from global trends in incidence of cancer and does not address geographic and ethnic variations related to NSCLCs with EGFR mutations.  Structure of EGFR and implications for exon 20 insertions EGFR is part of the ErbB family of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, which control signal transduction pathways that regulate proliferation and apoptosis.29 These transmembrane receptors subsist as monomers on the cell surface and homodimerise or heterodimerise in response to ligands, such as EGF, epiregulin, and transforming growth factor alpha.24 ;  30 EGFR, like most tyrosine kinases, has an on\\u2013off equilibrium that dictates its ability to transition into inactive and active states.31 ;  32 The active kinase state allows the transfer of a phosphate from ATP to a peptide substrate, which controls downstream signalling effectors.31 The kinase domain consists of a smaller N-terminal and a larger C-terminal lobe. The active ATP site lies in the cleft between these two lobes.31 ;  32 Crystal structures of wild-type and mutated EGFR with EGFR inhibitors have improved understanding of the differential response of these proteins to EGFR TKIs. For wild-type EGFR, the activation mechanism is driven by protein\\u2013protein interactions that resemble those observed in cyclin-dependent kinases.33 In its inactive state, the activation loop folds into a helix that prevents C-helix rotation toward the catalytic cleft.31 Dimerisation of EGFR, induced by ligands, allows intracellular kinase domains to be brought into a tail-to-head interaction (the C-terminal lobe of one molecule against the N-lobe of the other), which shifts the equilibrium into an active state by pushing the C-helix into an active position.31 ;  32  Recurrent EGFR mutations are localised within or are related to the ATP-binding site of the kinase ( figure 2). Leu858Arg and Leu861Gln lie within the activation loop of the kinase, Gly719X mutations occur at the P-loop, exon 19 deletions remove residues from the loop leading into the C-helix, and exon 20 insertions add residues within the N-terminal positions or at the opposite end of the C-helix (figure 1 and figure 2). Although only a few EGFR mutations (eg, Leu858Arg, Gly719Ser, and Thr790Met) have been studied in the context of their crystal structure with EGFR inhibitors, much has been learned from these models. 32; 34 ;  35 Leu858Arg and Gly719Ser aminoacid changes lead to a shift in equilibrium between active and inactive states of the tyrosine kinase domain that favours the activated state. 31; 32 ;  34 In kinetic kinase experiments using mutant forms of EGFR, proteins with Leu858Arg or exon 19 deletions exhibit significantly higher Michaelis constants for ATP (Km[ATP]; substrate concentration at half the maximum reaction rate), and have increased affinity (5\\u201310 times) to gefitinib or erlotinib compared with the wild-type receptor. 32; 36 ;  37 Compromised affinity for ATP is a hallmark of oncogene kinase mutants that respond to TKIs, and the gefitinib and erlotinib resistant EGFR Thr790Met mutation is thought to increase EGFR's affinity to ATP as a mechanism of decreasing the effectiveness of inhibition by gefitinib or erlotinib. 32 ;  35 Classic oncogenic EGFR mutations, by favouring the active kinase state, induce EGFR-mediated prosurvival and antiapoptotic signals through downstream targets such ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT. 29 ;  38 These intertwined networks mean that cells with EGFR mutations are inheritably dependent on a functional EGFR for their survival. 29 In these cells, inhibition of EGFR leads to upregulation of proapoptotic molecules (specifically BIM protein) that activate the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. 39; 40; 41 ;  42 The enhanced Km[ATP], increased binding to EGFR TKIs, and dependency on EGFR highlights the wide therapeutic window of gefitinib and erlotinib with classic EGFR mutation proteins compared with wild-type EGFR. This likely explains the remarkable clinical results seen with these TKIs in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.  Structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor ... Figure 2.  Structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) EGFR's kinase domain consists of a larger C-terminal and a smaller N-terminal lobe (C-lobe and N-lobe). The active site of the kinase lies within the cleft between the two lobes and is shown in the figure bound to erlotinib. The P-loop is shown in green, the activation loop (A-loop) in orange, and the C-helix in yellow. The structural location and aminoacid positions of the most relevant EGFR mutations are indicated by black arrows. Figure options The crystal structures of EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 20 insertions mutations have not been reported, but there are many speculations of their presumed effect on the function of the kinase domain.22 ;  32 It is likely that reduction of the loop leading into the C-helix, as occurs in exon 19 deletions, disfavours the helix adopting its outward inactive position, which might lead to an equilibrium shift to the active position of the kinase.32 If this hypothesis is true, then exon 20 insertions that occur after the C-helix might actually push the C-terminal end of the C-helix into an active position.32 However, how this affects the sensitivity (in the case of common exon 19 deletions) or resistance (in the case of characterised exon 20 insertions) to EGFR inhibitors will require elucidation of the crystal structures of these mutations.  Exon 20 of EGFR encompasses nucleotides that translate into aminoacid positions 762 to 823 ( figure 2). It starts at the N-terminus aminoacid position 762, which contains a catalytically important glutamate (Glu762), and is followed by position 763 within the C-helix of EGFR's tyrosine kinase domain.31 The C-helix, which ends at aminoacid Met766, is essential for EGFR's full kinase activity and has a role in its phosphotransfer ability.43 Of the many positions that are required for correct inactive-to-active kinase transition, the activation loop and the C-helix allow for correct aminoacid orientation (to facilitate ATP's phosphate transfer) and peptide substrate binding. 31 ;  32 Most of the previously published EGFR exon 20 insertions occur at the N-lobe of EGFR after the C-helix (after aminoacid Met766) and have been reported up to aminoacid Cys775; however, some C-helix exon 20 insertions have been reported that affect aminoacids Glu762 to Tyr764. 5; 44 ;  45 The restricted spectrum of residues that contain insertion mutations within exon 20, and its preferential location following the C-helix (aminoacids Ala767 to Cys775), might indicate the importance of this region in orienting the kinase into a state that controls ATP and EGFR TKI binding.  Frequency of EGFR exon 20 insertions Almost all exon 20 insertion mutations described up to now occur in 14 aminoacids of the N-lobe of EGFR, encompassing residues Glu762 to Cys775 (figure 2, table 1). The true frequency of exon 20 insertions within the larger EGFR mutated NSCLC pool is unknown, with reports describing from 1 to 10% contribution to the total number of EGFR mutations identified. 22; 24; 25 ;  44 However, 4% seems to be most widely reported in compiled cohorts of published EGFR mutations. 23 ;  24 A review of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) database showed that of 7066 unique samples from NSCLCs with identified EGFR mutations, only 114 (1\\u00b76%) contained exon 20 insertions. Nonetheless, of the 121 EGFR insertion mutations in COSMIC, almost all (114 [94%]) occur in exon 20, with the remaining mutations in residues of exon 19. These rare EGFR exon 19 insertions have been reported to be EGFR TKI-sensitising mutations. 54EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have not been reported in conjunction with classic EGFR mutations.

Table options The clinical and pathological characteristics associated with classic EGFR mutations also apply to exon 20 insertions. In most reports, never-smoker status, female sex, and adenocarcinoma histology were common characteristics of NSCLCs harbouring EGFR exon 20 insertions. 5; 25; 46; 47 ;  53 In a report of 13 patients from Taiwan with exon 20 insertion-containing tumours, 92% were never smokers, women, and had adenocarcinomas.25 No specific patient or tumour characteristic that differs from those of other EGFR mutations has been linked to exon 20 insertions.  Table 1 lists 122 EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations that have been published. More than 90% of all reported exon 20 insertions cluster between aminoacid positions Ser768 and Val774, and are therefore spatially located after the C-helix of the EGFR kinase domain ( figure 2). 20\\u00b75% of insertions begin after aminoacid Val769, 28\\u00b77% after Asp770, 17\\u00b72% after Pro772, and 14% after His773 (table 1). The most common mutation is Asp770_Asn771insSerValAsp, followed by Val769_Asp770insAlaSerVal. Asp770_Asn771insSerValAsp plus Ala767_Val769dupAlaSerVal and Val769_Asp770insAlaSerVal plus Ser768_Asp770dupSerValAsp have similar aminoacid sequences and account for 36% (44 of 122) of exon 20 insertions compiled in this review (table 1). Only 4\\u00b71% of all exon 20 insertion mutations occur within aminoacids that span the C-helix (Glu762 to Met766).  The preferential pattern of insertion mutations affecting aminoacid positions Ser768 to Val774 within the loop after the C-helix indicates that this area might be important for the conformational changes between the active and inactive conformation of EGFR. Insertions in this region can be oncogenic by preferentially promoting the active state of EGFR's kinase domain, and can affect Km[ATP] as well as the affinity of these receptors to gefitinib and erlotinib (ie, making the activating pocket less sensitive to gefitinib and erlotinib). Indeed, as will be described below, preclinical and clinical experience with the more prevalent EGFR insertion 20 mutations confirms the lack of sensitivity to EGFR TKIs.  Preclinical studies of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations By contrast with other EGFR activating mutations, no patient-derived cell line with an exon 20 insertion has been reported. Cell lines harbouring EGFR mutations, such as Leu858Arg (NCI-H3255, HCC4011), delGlu746_Ala750 (HCC827, PC9), and Leu858Arg-Thr790Met (NCI-H1975), have been invaluable for understanding the predictive role of EGFR TKIs and the biology of classic and resistant EGFR mutations. 39 ;  55 There are also no genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for exon 20 insertions, although many GEMM exist for classic EGFR mutations. 56 ;  57 With limited biological systems for studying the preclinical role of exon 20 insertions, most studies done so far have used surrogate assays to introduce EGFRs with exon 20 insertions into cells, such as NIH-3T3 and Ba/F3, before evaluating their response or resistance to EGFR TKIs (table 2).

Table options The few mutations that have been studied in vitro, including Ala767_Val769dupAlaSerVal,27 ;  58 Asp770_Asn771insAsnProGly,26; 27 ;  59 delAsn771insGlyTyr,50 and His773_Val774insHis,27 have been shown to be resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib; the insertions had 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) to gefitinib or erlotinib, of higher than 3 \\u03bcmol/L (table 2). This degree of inhibition is similar to that seen in EGFR proteins with the resistant mutation Thr790Met,64 ;  65 and more than 500 times more resistant than Leu858Arg or delGlu746_Ala750 mutations (table 2). Since the median trough serum concentrations of gefitinib (molecular weight [MW] 446\\u00b790) at 250\\u2013500 mg/day and erlotinib (MW 429\\u00b790) at 150 mg/day range from 0\\u00b75\\u20133\\u00b70 \\u03bcmol/L,38; 60 ;  61 these preclinical data conform to the observation that NSCLCs with the aforementioned exon 20 insertions have not responded to usual doses of gefitinib or erlotinib. Most exon 20 insertions identified in patient samples (table 1) have not been tested against reversible EGFR TKIs using in-vitro systems. Extrapolations from the few tested mutations might not apply for other exon 20 mutations.  EGFR exon 20 mutant proteins have also been studied in the context of irreversible EGFR TKIs that have entered clinical trials in NSCLC.27; 50; 58 ;  59 Results with neratinib (previously called HKI-272), afatinib (previously called BIBW2992), and PF00299804 show that Ala767_Val769dupAlaSerVal, Asp770_Asn771insAsnProGly, delAsn771insGlyTyr, and His773_Val774insHis have an IC50 to these compounds in similar dose ranges as EGFR Thr790Met models (table 2). These exon 20 insertions were, on average, 100 times less sensitive than the classic Leu858Arg and exon 19 deletions (table 2). Phase 1 trials of irreversible EGFR TKIs have established their pharmacokinetic parameters in humans. Neratinib (MW 557\\u00b709) at a dose of 240 mg/day achieves a median trough plasma concentration of 73\\u00b75 ng/mL, equivalent to 0\\u00b713 \\u03bcM.49 ;  62 Afatinib (MW 485\\u00b794) at a dose of 40\\u201350 mg/day has a median trough concentration of 18\\u00b77\\u201333\\u00b77 ng/mL, or 0\\u00b703\\u20130\\u00b706 \\u03bcmol/L.63 PF00299804 (assuming an MW similar to CI1003, at 558\\u00b786) at a dose of 30\\u201345 mg/day leads to a trough plasma concentration of 32\\u00b78\\u201377\\u00b78 ng/mL, or 0\\u00b705\\u20130\\u00b713 \\u03bcmol/L.51 Therefore, for almost all irreversible inhibitors detailed above, the achievable plasma concentrations of the compounds are below the IC50 of most studied EGFR exon 20 insertions (table 2). Therefore, we expect that afatinib and PF00299804 would only be clinically effective in classic EGFR mutations (Leu858Arg or exon 19 deletions), and not in EGFR mutated tumours with exon 20 insertions or Thr790Met.  Other preclinical strategies that have shown promise in EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) mutated tumours include the use of heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibitors, 66 dual inhibition of the downstream PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MEK-ERK pathways, 67 ;  68 and addition of apoptotic mimetics, such as BH3-mimetics, to EGFR TKIs. 39; 40; 41 ;  42 Although exon 20 insertions were not specifically tested in these models, we assume that the data obtained with classic EGFR mutated and EGFR-Thr790Met cells and GEMM would similarly apply. Conversely, few of these strategies have been effective in patients or reached clinical development, and the ultimate role in clinical practice is unknown.  Preclinical models with EGFR exon 20 insertions have been rudimentary so far, but have helped establish a biological correlation between clinical experience and the in-vitro response of these mutations to EGFR TKIs. Additionally, these models can be used for initial screening of more active EGFR TKIs against EGFR 20 insertions. However, patient-derived cell lines and GEMM models of common EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are urgently needed to enhance our preclinical understanding of the intrinsic behaviour of these tumours.  Clinical studies with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations Gefitinib and erlotinib are widely used EGFR TKIs in NSCLC, and many retrospective and prospective reports have genotyped EGFR and correlated the pattern of radiographic and clinical responses seen with subtypes of EGFR mutations. Anecdotal reports, dating back to 2005, indicated that NSCLCs with EGFR exon 20 insertions were not as responsive to gefitinib or erlotinib as tumours with EGFR Gly719X, Leu858Arg, Leu861Gln, and exon 19 deletions. 26 These initial observations agreed with preclinical data that showed that some exon 20 insertions were not inhibited by achievable doses of reversible EGFR TKIs.  Table 3 summarises reported responses of patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertions to gefitinib and erlotinib. The true radiographic RR was low at 5% (one in 20 patients) and it seems only 15% (three of 20) had prolonged periods of disease control. A study of three patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions reported a median PFS of 1\\u00b75 months, 54 and a study of seven patients (one with Ala767_Val769dupAlaSerVal, four with Ser768_Asp770dupSerValAsp, one with Asp770_Asn771insAsp, and one with Pro772_His773insTyrAsnPro) reported a median PFS of 2 months.25 Of the main randomised clinical trials of gefitinib and erlotinib that included molecular EGFR genotyping, such as BR.21, 70 IDEAL,52 INTACT,52 IPASS,20 TRIBUTE,48 and the largest prospective database of patients with EGFR mutations who were given erlotinib, 11 only three EGFR insertion 20 mutations were reported. This paucity of exon 20 insertions is partly due to use of highly sensitive genotyping methods that do not routinely interrogate exon 20 insertions, or that only detect the most common classic EGFR mutations. This has made it difficult to evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of EGFR exon 20 insertions in prospective trials of patients with NSCLC. As more data become available from new prospective trials of EGFR TKIs, it might be possible to evaluate the RR of a multitude of exon 20 insertion mutations and assess whether the location or type of mutation affects RRs and clinical benefit. However, data available so far suggest that common EGFR exon 20 insertions, such as mutations after aminoacids Ala767, Ser768, Asn770, Pro772, and His773, confer de-novo resistance to clinically achievable doses of gefitinib and erlotinib. For rarer EGFR exon 20 insertions, specifically those that affect aminoacids within the C-helix, which account for around 4% of all exon 20 insertions (five of 122 mutations; table 1) and encompass Glu762, Ala763, Tyr764, and Val765 to Met766, there are no preclinical data to support their pattern of resistance to EGFR TKIs. Two patients with tumours harbouring Tyr764_Val765insHisHis or Met766_Ala767insAIa had prolonged periods of disease control with reversible EGFR TKIs (table 2).  Table 3.

Table options Responses of NSCLCs with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations to irreversible EGFR inhibitors have been recently reported ( table 4). In a phase 2 trial of neratinib, three patients with exon 20 EGFR mutated NSCLC (Ser768_Asp770dupSerValAsp, His773_Val774dupHisVal, delAsn771insGlyPhe [Sequist L, Massachusetts General Hospital, USA, personal communication]) did not have radiographic responses. 49 In an initial phase 1 trial of PF00299804, six patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions were included and only one (with delAsn770insGlyTyr) had a response. 51 The calculated median PFS for these six patients was roughly 3 months. A phase 2 trial of afatinib enrolled 11 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, and only one had a partial response. The investigator-assessed PFS for these patients was short, at 2\\u00b78 months, 71 ;  72 and the overall RR for neratinib, afatinib, and PF00299804 was low, at 10% (two of 20). The absence of significant clinical responses in these trials was predicted by in-vitro preclinical studies, which found that achievable plasma concentrations of neratinib, afatinib, and PF00299804 are below inhibitory concentrations of some exon 20 insertion mutations (table 2). Nevertheless, a patient with delAsp770insGlyTyr had a response of 13\\u00b75 months to PF00299084.51 A similar mutation, delAsn771insGlyTyr, was inhibited by achievable plasma concentrations of PF00299084 in vitro.50  Table 4.

Table options Very few other clinical strategies have been used specifically for EGFR mutated NSCLC with exon 20 insertions. Among the many trials of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, a study of an Hsp90 inhibitor (IPI-504) did include one patient with an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. 73 The activity of IPI-504 was disappointing (less than 5%) in the 28 patients with tumours harbouring EGFR mutations, and the tumour with an exon 20 insertion was non-responsive.  Overall, the activity of available reversible (gefitinib, erlotinib) and irreversible (neratinib, afatinib, and PF00299804) EGFR TKIs is limited for most EGFR exon 20 mutation-positive NSCLCs, and alternative treatment strategies may be needed for these specific tumours.  Implications for drug development and patient care Classic EGFR mutations, such as Leu858Arg and exon 19 deletions, have become the most robust predictive marker for clinical benefit with EGFR TKIs, in patients with NSCLC. 20 ;  74 However, not all EGFR mutations have the same effect. For the most commonly reported EGFR exon 20 insertions, there is growing preclinical and clinical evidence that these mutation types are unique and do not enhance the sensitivity of the EGFR kinase domain, or of tumours harbouring these mutated oncogenes, to EGFR TKIs. EGFR exon 20 insertions may account for up to 4% of EGFR mutations, 22 ;  23 occur in the same group of patients and tumours with with classic EGFR mutations (women, never smokers, adenocarcinomas), 25 cluster around aminoacid positions Ser768 and Val774 located in the N-lobe of the kinase domain of EGFR after the C-helix (table 1, figure 1, and figure 2), lead to a pattern of in-vitro resistance to reversible (gefitinib, erlotinib) and irreversible (neratinib, afatinib, PF00299804) EGFR TKIs (table 2), and are rarely associated with meaningful clinical responses to EGFR inhibitors in patients given gefitinib, erlotinib, neratinib, afatinib, or PF00299804 (table 3 and table 4).  The lack of a crystallographic structure of an EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutated protein, a patient-derived cell line with an EGFR exon 20 insertion, and a GEMM with the most common insertion mutations (eg, Asp770_Asn771insSerValAsp or Val769_Asp770insAlaSerVal) has hampered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the patterns of resistance of these mutations to EGFR TKIs. Any of these developments is eagerly awaited. In the meantime, selectively screening a kinase inhibitor library for novel EGFR TKIs that are specific for the most clinically relevant EGFR insertion 20 mutations, such as was recently done for EGFR Tyr790Met, 75 might yield a compound for preclinical and clinical studies. Other approaches include combinations of EGFR TKIs and downstream inhibitors, as was shown in a GEMM of the HER2 insertion mutation Ala775insTyrValMetAla (similar in structure to EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations that occur after aminoacid 767), with afatinib and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. 68 Indeed, a phase 1 clinical trial of neratinib and temsirolimus (NCT00838539) is seeking to enrol patients with NSCLCs with EGFR exon 20 or HER2 insertions. The combination of an EGFR monoclonal antibody (eg, cetuximab) and an irreversible EGFR TKI (eg, afatinib) has shown promise in preclinical models of EGFR Tyr790Met-driven tumours. 76 This combination could also be studied in preclinical models and subsequently in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, if the initial phase 1 clinical trial of afatinib plus cetuximab (NCT01090011) in patients with NSCLCs with classic EGFR mutations and acquired resistance to erlotinib shows clinical activity. The need to identify a treatment strategy unique to patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions and to understand the pattern of resistance to EGFR TKIs of these NSCLCs highlights the importance of genotyping tumours for these mutation types.  In summary, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations affecting aminoacids Ala767, Ser768, Asp770, Pro772, and His773 are resistant to clinically achievable doses of EGFR inhibitors that have gained regulatory approval or entered late-stage clinical trials, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, neratinib, afatinib, and PF00299804. Outside of a clinical trial that specifically targets these mutations, patients with advanced NSCLC and tumours harbouring the most common EGFR exon 20 insertions should be treated with conventional systemic therapies that are available for EGFR wild-type tumours. 74 Future research into the structure of EGFR exon 20 insertions and the availability of preclinical models for the study of these aberrant EGFR proteins could help identify therapeutics for this significant cohort of patients with NSCLCs.   Purpose: Clinical reports about responsiveness to gefitinib treatment in patients of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutations in exon 20 of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are limited. To increase understanding of the influence of exon 20 mutations on NSCLC treatment with gefitinib, we investigated the clinical features of lung cancer in patients with exon 20 mutations and analyzed the gefitinib treatment response.  Experimental Design: We surveyed the clinical data and mutational studies of NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations in the National Taiwan University Hospital and reviewed the literature reports about EGFR exon 20 mutations and the gefitinib treatment response.  Results: Twenty-three patients with mutations in exon 20 were identified. Nine (39%) had coexisting mutations in EGFR exons other than exon 20. Sixteen patients received gefitinib treatment, and a response was noted in 4 patients. The gefitinib response rate of NSCLC with exon 20 mutations was 25%, far lower than those with deletions in exon 19 and L858R mutations. Interestingly, different exon 20 mutations and coexisting mutations seemed to have a different influence on gefitinib response.  Conclusions: EGFR exon 20 mutations of NSCLC patients result in poorer responsiveness to gefitinib treatment, but variability exists between different individuals.  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane glycoprotein, is related to the proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of cells. A loss of constraints on the EGFR due to deregulation, amplification, or mutations may result in a malignant change of cells (1, 2). A series of EGFR kinase domain mutations have been discovered in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), primarily adenocarcinoma, in recent years (3\\u20135). The mutations exist in exons 18 to 21, which encompass most of the tyrosine kinase binding domain of EGFR (6). The clinical courses and survival of lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations can be changed with the treatment of gefitinib (7\\u20139), a small molecule that is a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (10).  Patients with EGFR mutations and effective responsiveness to gefitinib in previous studies were found to have mutations primarily in exons 18, 19, and 21 (7, 9, 11\\u201319). These are substitutions for G719 in the nucleotide-binding loop of exon 18, in-frame deletions within exon 19, and substitutions for L858 or L861 in the activation loop in exon 21. Mutations in exon 20 could be in-frame duplication and/or insertion, such as A767_V769dupASV or H773_V774insH (20). They could also be point mutations. Examples of reported exon 20 mutations in literature are V765M, S768I, H773R, and T790M (9, 11, 21\\u201324). Only a handful of reports have described lung cancer with EGFR mutations in exon 20, and the population was small (8, 20, 21, 24\\u201328). This is probably because of the innate smaller percentage of exon 20 mutations in the EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Experience is even limited about gefitinib treatment on lung cancer with exon 20 mutations (8, 21, 25). Cell models in vitro have shown that transformation by D770_N771insNPG of exon 20 brings about resistance to gefitinib (29). In the patient group of the study conducted by Chou et al. (8), the five patients with exon 20 mutations had a shorter duration of gefitinib response than those with other mutations. However, more clinical data are required. To increase our understanding of the influence of exon 20 mutations on gefitinib treatment response, we investigated the clinical features of lung cancer with exon 20 mutations and reviewed relevant literature reports about exon 20 mutations.  Materials and Methods  Patients. The study group included lung cancer patients diagnosed at the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2000 and June 2007. All patients underwent complete lung cancer staging, including bronchoscopy, computed tomography of the head, chest, and abdomen, and whole-body bone scintigraphy. The clinical data from the patients, including demographic information, clinical staging, cell histology, and treatments received and responsiveness were recorded. Smoking status was recorded with direct statements of patients at the time of admission for management of lung cancer. Patients who had smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime were categorized as never smokers. Those who smoked cigarettes within 1 year of the diagnosis were categorized as current smokers. The others were categorized as former smokers. Lung cancer histology was defined according to the WHO pathology classification (30). Tumor specimens obtained by either surgical or needle biopsy/aspiration procedures, including primary lung lesions, malignant effusion cell blocks, and other distant metastases, were sequenced for mutational analysis. Patients screened for EGFR mutations were (a) those who were in the studies of clinical trial (31), (b) those who underwent fine-needle biopsies or thoracentesis for pleural effusions after July 2004 when consecutive recruitment for EGFR mutations was started in the hospital, (c) those whose resected tumors were retrospectively sequenced, or (d) those who were recruited for retrospective NSCLC studies (32, 33). Written informed consent for use of tissue in molecular analysis was acquired from patients at the time of procurement of tumor specimens. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital.  Gefitinib treatment and evaluation of effectiveness. Patient information regarding treatment with gefitinib was obtained from a search of records of the Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital. When administered, gefitinib was taken orally at a dosage of 250 mg/d. Baseline assessments were usually done within 2 weeks before treatment. For patients who were in the clinical trial (31), computed tomography of all the measurable tumor sites was done every 8 weeks. Response to treatment, time to progression, and survival were retrieved from the data set of the clinical trial. For patients who did not participate in clinical trials, chest radiography was routinely done and assessed every 2 to 3 weeks to evaluate responses after the start of treatment. A chest computed tomography scan (including liver and adrenal glands) was done every 2 to 3 months as routine clinical practice and as needed to confirm the response and progression of disease. With measurable tumor sizes, treatment responses were defined as progressive disease, stable disease, partial response, and complete response according to the criteria of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors group (34). Patients with complete remission or partial remission were regarded as responders to gefitinib, whereas the others were regarded as nonresponders. Progression-free survival was calculated from the date of initiation of gefitinib treatment to the date of disease progression. For patients receiving gefitinib, survival duration was calculated from the start of gefitinib to the death of the patients. For patients who did not receive gefitinib, survival duration was calculated from the diagnosis of lung cancer to death. Patients who were not deceased were censored at the date of last contact in this institution.  Mutational analysis of EGFR. Tumor specimens, including paraffin blocks or frozen tissues of surgical specimens, fine-needle biopsies, and pleural effusions, were procured. These formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital. The mutational analysis of EGFR genes has been described previously (32). Briefly, DNA was derived from tumors embedded in paraffin blocks using a QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). The tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR coding sequence exons 18 to 21 were amplified, and independent PCR amplifications were purified and sequenced in an automatic ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer.  The frozen lung cancer tissues were obtained at surgery, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until use. Total mRNA was extracted from resected cancer tissue using a RNA extraction kit (RNeasy Mini kit; Qiagen). The four exons (exon 18-21) that code for the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene were amplified with primers and PCR conditions as reported previously (35). Reverse transcription-PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced.  All sequencing reactions were done in both forward and reverse directions using tracings from at least two PCR.  Statistical analyses. All categorical variables were analyzed with \\u03c72 tests. Significance was determined if P < 0.05. All analyses were done using the SPSS software (version 13.0 for Windows; SPSS).  Results  Characteristics of lung cancer patients. There were 4,737 NSCLC patients seen in the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2000 and June 2007. Specimens from 515 (11%) patients were examined for mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. They included 195 surgical specimens, 101 fine-needle biopsies (either echo guided, computer tomography guided, or bronchoscopic), and 219 cell block preparations of pleural effusion. There were 441 adenocarcinomas, 69 squamous carcinomas, and 5 small cell carcinomas. Of the total 515 patients, 201 were smokers, 50 former smokers, and 151 current smokers. Two hundred and fifty-three (49%) patients had EGFR mutations. The mutations were more frequent in never smokers than former or current smokers (74% versus 26%; P < 0.001), in adenocarcinomas than nonadenocarcinomas (96% versus 4%; P < 0.001), and in females than in males (61% versus 39%; P < 0.001). Two hundred and twenty-five (89%) patients had exon 19 and/or 21 mutations, and 13 patients had exon 18 mutations (5%).  We identified 23 lung cancer patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations, solely or with other mutations (Table 1 ). Nine (39%) had coexisting mutations in EGFR exons other than exon 20. Six patients (cases 2, 5, 7, and 11-13) were in a clinical trial of first-line gefitinib treatment (31), whereas the others were not in clinical trials. Clinical results on four patients had been reported previously (33, 36). The demographic information was as follows: 19 (83%) were female, the median age at which lung cancer was diagnosed was 65 years (ranging between 40 and 87 years), and 20 (87%) were never smokers with the other 3 being current smokers. Regarding the cell type of cancer, 22 patients had adenocarcinomas. The other one, who was a current smoker, had squamous carcinoma. Therefore, the exon 20 mutations predominantly occurred in females, never smokers, and adenocarcinoma, as with the other types of EGFR mutations. Half (52%) of the patients were stage IV at the diagnosis of lung cancer.  View inlineView popup Table 1. Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Gefitinib treatment on patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations. Medical records from all 23 patients were reviewed in detail. Sixteen of the 23 patients had received gefitinib treatment: 13 as first-line treatment, 1 as second-line treatment, and 2 as third-line treatment (Table 1). All of the gefitinib treatment courses were given as the sole therapy, without other concurrent chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy for the primary lung tumor. At the start of gefitinib treatment, 2 were stage IIIb and the other 14 were stage IV. Nine had point mutations in exon 20 and seven had insertion/duplication mutations in exon 20 as listed in Table 2 . Eight (50%) had more than one mutation. Among the coexisting mutations other than exon 20, seven were in exon 21 (six L858R and one L861Q) and one in exon 18 (G719A).  View inlineView popup Table 2. EGFR mutation patterns and clinicopathologic features of 23 patients with exon 20 mutations Four (25%) patients (cases 2, 4, 6, and 12 in Table 2) reached partial response after gefitinib treatment, and 12 (75%) were nonresponders to gefitinib. For the 4 responders to gefitinib, the median progression-free survival was 79 weeks (range, 61-95) and the median survival duration after gefitinib was 23 months (range, 20-32). Three of these four patients had a coexisting mutation, L858R in exon 21, in addition to exon 20 mutations (Table 2).  In the 12 nonresponders, the median progression-free survival was 8 weeks (range, 1-17) and the median survival duration after gefitinib treatment was 7 months (range, 1-30 months). For the nonresponders, gefitinib was the only treatment in 2 patients. The other 10 patients had undergone a median of 3 (range, 1-5) regimens of chemotherapy other than gefitinib. However, 9 of these 10 patients were not responsive to any chemotherapy (stable disease or progressive disease as maximal response), with the exception of 1 patient (case 8) who reached a partial response to docetaxel as the third-line regimen.  Clinical courses of patients without gefitinib treatment. Seven patients with exon 20 mutations had never received gefitinib treatment (Table 2, cases 17-23). Three patients (cases 19, 20, and 23) received tumor resection in stage Ib of lung cancer. No recurrence was noted after the operations. Case 21 underwent operation for his stage IIIa tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but he expired 1 month later due to unrelated complications without evidence of cancer recurrence. The other three patients (cases 17, 18, and 22) received chemotherapy for cancer control. Case 17 achieved stable disease after first-line gemcitabine. The tumor progressed 6 months later, and he continued with further chemotherapy treatments. Cases 18 and 22 failed to respond to chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin for case 18 and paclitaxel with carboplatin for case 22), and both of them expired due to cancer-related respiratory complications.  Discussion  In the large-scale study conducted by Shigematsu et al. (20), 130 of the total 617 lung cancer patients had EGFR mutations distributed within exons 18 to 21. These mutations were associated with several clinical features: a higher incidence in never smokers compared with smokers, a higher incidence in adenocarcinoma compared with cancers of other cell types, and a higher percentage in female patients. The data in our study supported these findings. The 23 patients with exon 20 mutations in our study exhibited a similar predominance of females, never smokers, and adenocarcinomas. The similarity of these clinical features did not include the response to gefitinib, however.  As shown by cell lines and molecular studies, the mutant EGFR can transform fibroblasts and pulmonary epithelial cells without exogenous epidermal growth factors (3, 24). Gefitinib limits the growth of cells transformed via the mutant EGFR, which may explain the positive clinical responsiveness to gefitinib of lung cancer accompanied by mutant EGFR. For example, in the study of recurrent lung cancer after surgery (37), gefitinib was effective in 24 of 29 patients with EGFR mutations but only effective in 2 of 21 patients without mutations. Mutations were localized primarily to exons 19 and 21, with the exception of 3 patients who had mutations in exon 18. Furthermore, in another study of chemotherapy-naive lung cancer patients in stage IIIb and IV with EGFR mutations, 12 of 16 patients had objective response to gefitinib (16). Similarly, all the sensitive mutations were in exons 19 and 21.  Several studies on the gefitinib treatment response of tumors with EGFR exon 20 mutations have been published, albeit with relatively small patient numbers (Table 3 ). The effective treatment percentage in these studies ranged from 0% to 75% (8, 21, 22, 25). In our study, 4 of 16 patients reached a partial response after gefitinib treatment, with a significantly longer progression-free duration. Taken together, the investigations listed in Table 3 give an average 34% (11 of 32) gefitinib response rate, which is much lower than that for mutations in exons 19 and 21.  View inlineView popup Table 3. Studies reporting lung cancer with exon 20 EGFR mutations and gefitinib treatment In the in vitro study conducted by Greulich et al., mutations in exon 20 (D770_N771insNPG) confer EGFR mutant cell resistance to gefitinib in contrast to mutations in other exons (29). These transformed cells with exon 20 mutations were sensitive to the irreversible inhibitor CL-387785, and development of alternative kinase inhibition strategies was suggested (6, 29, 38). This accounts for the lower gefitinib responsive rate in treating patients with exon 20 mutations. However, as mentioned earlier, there are still some patients with exon 20 mutations who respond to gefitinib treatment clinically. Clearly, the cellar and molecular studies do not completely explain the clinical outcomes observed.  What contributes to this disparity is not currently understood. One possibility is the diverse distribution of mutations in exon 20 (Table 4 ). Theoretically, mutations might be in-frame duplications, in-frame insertions, in-frame duplications plus insertions, or point mutations (11, 20, 21). Patients with point mutations may have different amino acid substitutions and may thereby have different responsiveness to gefitinib treatment. For example, both cases 3 and 4 in our study had two point mutations at identical amino acid locations. The mutation in exon 21 is the same, L858R, but mutations in exon 20 were replaced by different amino acids. Case 4, the responder to gefitinib, had mutation R776H, whereas case 3 had mutation R776G and did not respond to gefitinib. Another possible cause of different treatment outcomes is the coexistence of mutations in other exons of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. Combining our study and the reports in literature, there were 5 patients having mutation S768I who were treated with gefitinib. They had different coexisting EGFR mutations, however, and the responses to gefitinib were also different (responders had G719C or L858R, whereas nonresponders expressed G719A or V769L; refs. 9, 22). Whether these mutational differences explain gefitinib responsiveness is not clear, and further studies are still required for clarification.  View inlineView popup Table 4. Gefitinib response of EGFR exon 20 mutations Another interesting finding is the high prevalence of exon 20 mutations coexisting with other mutations (Table 4). In published reports, of the 32 patients treated with gefitinib, only 14 (44%) had single exon 20 mutations. In these, patients with a single exon 20 mutation had a lower gefitinib response rate (21%) than those with coexisting mutations (44%). Besides, exon 20 mutations presenting as insertions, duplications, or deletions are all single-site mutations and appeared in 10 patients. Only one of these was responsiveness to gefitinib, a much lower response rate than exon 20 point mutations. Another particular exon 20 mutation T790M led to unresponsiveness in all three patients who possessed it, although this was a point mutation coexisting with L858R (23, 31, 32). Overall, patients who had T790M or the insertion/duplication/deletion mutations in exon 20 seemed to have unfavorable response to gefitinib treatment.  The major limitation of this report is its retrospective nature. EGFR mutations in exon 20 are rare, and we extensively recruited reports in the literature to investigate the role of exon 20 mutations in the treatment of NSCLC patients. Some prospective trials are currently ongoing (46, 47), and we look forward to future clinical results on exon 20 mutations.  In conclusion, we reported a larger group of lung cancer patients with mutations in EGFR exon 20 than those previously published. Together with cases reported in literature, mutations in exon 20 were conducive to lower response rate to gefitinib treatment generally, but variability existed between cases. Further clinical and laboratory studies are required to improve the treatment of lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 mutations. Introduction The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-bound protein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. When activated, it triggers a signaling pathway that leads to several cell proliferation signals [1]. Findings in the last decade showed that mutations in this TK domain could lead to a permanent activation of this pathway. Several specific TK inhibitors, usable as therapeutic agents, have been developed [erlotinib (Roche, Switzerland) and gefitinib (AstraZeneca, UK)] and have dramatically modified management and prognosis of lung cancers at advanced stages.  Most EGFR mutations are located in exons 18\\u201321 of the TK domain, and ~85 % of them are in exons 19 and 21 [2]. Most mutations confer an increased sensitivity to TK inhibitors (TKI). These sensitizing mutations are mainly a deletion in exon 19 (Del19), L858R substitution in exon 21, and some substitutions in exon 18. Recently, exon 19 insertions have been described as a new type of sensitizing mutation [3]. Beside these mutations, some lead to TKI resistance and prevent their prescription. The best known mutation is the T790 M substitution in exon 20. Others are insertions or duplications in this same exon. Finally, some mutations have been rarely reported and their effects under TKI treatment remain unknown. Most of them have been reported at a collaborative website [4].  Sensitizing mutations appear to be the best predictive factor for response under TKI treatment [5]. They are more common in women, never-smokers, and Asians. Some authors have even developed tools, based on clinical characteristics, to estimate the \\u201crisk\\u201d of EGFR mutations [6]. The median progression free survival (PFS) for metastatic lung cancer patients harboring a sensitizing EGFR mutation and who underwent a TKI treatment in first line ranges from 9.7 to 13.1 months for erlotinib [7, 8] and from 9.2 to 10.8 months for gefitinib [9, 10] in a Caucasian and an Asian population, respectively. Therefore, most guidelines recommend determining the EGFR status of the tumor sample and to give oral TKI drugs in such patients in first line [11, 12]. Thus, in the late 2000s, EGFR mutation analysis became essential in order to offer the best chance of survival to patients.  France was the first country to provide routine EGFR mutation analysis for every patient. The French National Cancer Institute (INCa) has launched a network of 28 centers, each consisting of one or several laboratories that perform molecular analysis of tumors. All physicians, regardless of their practice (public or private) and their location, may send tumor samples to their corresponding center without additional fees [13]. EGFR mutations analysis currently is recommended for adenocarcinoma histology (regardless of sex or tobacco smoking status), never-smokers (irrespective of histology), and stages IIIB/IV only. Method of analysis (PCR based or direct sequencing) and field of analysis (exons 18\\u201321 in total or in part) are both chosen by the corresponding lab. Indeed, a recent study comparing these methods to a reference lab did not show any significant difference [14]. The laboratory of the University Hospital of Lyon chose to detect the mutation by direct sequencing, considering that it is the gold standard when tumor cells in the sample are carefully selected [15]. Moreover, the lab aimed to sequence exons 18\\u201321 whenever possible.  Results and the feasibility of routine analysis from such a French molecular biology center have never been reported. Moreover, outcomes of patients with EGFR mutations have never been assessed in this context. Our study aimed to describe EGFR status in a French population, to look for predictive factors associated with successful analysis, and to describe outcomes of patients with this mutation. To our knowledge it is the first study that focused on this exciting new approach in lung cancer.  Methods EGFR Mutation Diagnosis Tumor samples are shipped to the lab by pathologists under clinician request. They are then microdissected (microdissector LMD2000, Leica, Germany) in order to select areas of the sample with the most tumor cells and the smallest amount of normal tissue. Thus, samples comprise at least 75 % tumor cells. Tumor DNA is then extracted using a QIAampl DNA micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). EGFR exons 18\\u201321 are amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers detailed in Supplementary Table 1. For exons 20 and 21, overlapping PCR with primers S1-AS3 and S3-AS1 was used in case of failure of amplification with primer S1-AS1. At least 4 ng per PCR process of tumor DNA was required for further analysis. This can be achieved when a tumor area of at least 106 \\u03bcm2 is available on a 4-\\u03bcm sample slide. Products from PCR were then sequenced by using the same primers (except for exon 21 for which primer EGFR21-AS2 was used instead of EGFR21-AS1). Direct sequencing used the Big Dye Terminator v1.3 and the genetic analyzer ABI PRISM 3100 (both from Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sense and antisense sequences were performed with two independent PCR products and were read by the biologist of the platform. The result was reported as \\u201cindeterminate\\u201d if sequencing for at least exon 19 or 21 was not performed. However, samples with complete sequencing of exon 19 and 21 but with incomplete analysis of either exon 18 or exon 19 were reported as wild-type.  Samples are processed every week so the delay between receiving the sample and the report is usually no more than 7 days. After adding 1\\u20133 weeks for shipping, the report usually is available for physicians in 10 days.  Data Collection As EGFR analysis is routinely done in France, this study did not need any approval by an ethics committee. All samples sent to the Lyon University Hospital laboratory for EGFR analysis during the first year of activity (from September 2009 to September 2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Samples from malignancies other than lung cancer were excluded. Sex, age, sample origin, type of sample, and histology were normally reported on the form sent with the sample. Results from EGFR analysis were available in the platform archives.  For patients diagnosed with a mutation regardless of its type (sensitizing, resistance, unknown effect, or unknown mutation), a standardized questionnaire was sent to the referring clinician to retrospectively collect further data and outcomes. All physicians answered this questionnaire.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v16.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Comparison of proportions was done using the \\u03c72 test or Fisher\\u2019s exact test as recommended. Mean comparison was done using the Student t test after variance comparison. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Survival curves were designed with the Kaplan\\u2013Meier method. Comparisons of median survivals were calculated by the log rank test. Multivariate analysis used a binary logistic regression (entry method). Odds ratios are represented with their corresponding 95 % confidence interval.  Results The fate of the 800 samples received during the study period (first year of activity) is summarized in Fig. 1. Among those, 792 samples (corresponding to 753 patients) were analyzed for an EGFR mutation (seven samples were not included because they did not involve lung cancer and one sample because it had already been analyzed) and were included in this study. More than 8 % (n = 70) of the samples were reported as indeterminate. Nevertheless, among those, 22 samples were able to be reanalyzed. Consequently, the final rate of indeterminate analysis was 6.3 %. The two main reasons for indeterminate results were a low quantity of DNA or tumor cells (values were unfortunately not recorded) in the sample and the poor quality of the extracted DNA. Factors associated with a significant increased risk of indeterminate results were searched for by multivariate analysis. Neither cytological nor frozen samples were associated with an increased risk of failure. However, samples originating from bone tissue were associated with a higher risk of failure, with a corresponding odds ratio of 2.43 (95 % CI = 1.005\\u20135.460, p = 0.049). Moreover, sequencing for exon 18 and/or exon 20 in 82 additional samples (13.7 %) was not possible because of some technical conditions. These were considered \\u201cwild type.\\u201d Overall, 133 EGFR mutations were diagnosed in 124 samples (15.7 %), corresponding to 121 patients (16.06 %).  Fig. 1 Flowchart showing the fate of the 800 samples addressed to the platform The main characteristics of the whole population and of the cluster of patients with mutations are summarized in Table 1. Eighty percent of the samples were adenocarcinomas. As expected, mutations were more common among never-smokers (60 %) and females (63 %, p < 0.0001). Almost all had an adenocarcinoma (97 %, p = 0.005). By contrast, there was no difference according to age or origin of the sample (i.e., public vs. private healthcare facility).

More than two-thirds of the detected mutations were sensitizing and located mainly in exons 19 (47.3 %) and 21 (24.8 %). L858R and Del19 mutations were the most frequent sensitizing ones, accounting for 30.1 and 61.2 % of all diagnosed sensitizing mutations, respectively. Ten (7.5 %) mutations were detected in exon 18 in 6 patients (2 patients had one mutation and 4 patients had multiple mutations), and 70 % were sensitizing. Eleven samples showed a resistance mutation (8.3 %) and all were located in exon 20. Finally, 19 samples (14.3 %) showed either mutations that have never been described to our knowledge or mutations with unknown effects on TKI sensitivity due to their rareness. Table 2 Results of EGFR analysis in the 121 patients harboring a mutation  \\u0394 deletion, Dup duplication, Ins insertion, NDM not described mutation, UKE unknown effect (no more than one patient treated), TKI tyrosine kinase inhibitor, P progression, SD stable disease, CR complete response, PR partial response, NE not evaluated  Among the 121 patients with EGFR mutations, 85 (70 %) underwent TKI drug therapy (see Tables 2, 3). Erlotinib was used by 43.5 % and gefitinib was used in 55.3 %. A TKI therapy was used in first-line treatment in 41.9 %. Efficacy data were available for 93 % of treated patients and are given in Table 3. Median PFS was significantly different only for patients with performance status (PS) greater than or equal to 2 compared with those with a lower PS (p = 0.001, see Table 4). Interestingly, we found no difference with respect to the kind of TKI drug used (gefitinib or erlotinib) or the line of prescription (see Fig. 2). We also looked for a difference in survival with respect to the mutated exon. There was a significant difference in PFS with respect to exons 18, 19, and 21 (p < 0.0001; see Table 4), but this difference disappears when only exons 19 and 21 are compared (p = 0.3). These observations suggest that exon 18 mutations have a worse prognosis than exon 19 or 21 mutations. Finally, the most frequently reported adverse effects of TKI drugs were rash, folliculitis, and diarrhea. Dose reductions were more frequent in the erlotinib group than in the gefitinib group (p = 0.001, Table 3).

Moreover, it used direct sequencing after microdissection, which guarantees its robustness [15]. Indeed, since laser capture microdissection allows accurate selection of tumor areas, the analysis can be performed regardless of tumor infiltration. However, a minimal amount of tumor should be present in the sample to allow a minimal amount of DNA input for each PCR. Furthermore, highly sensitive methods for mutation detection are not required after laser capture microdissection since the DNA analyzed originates mainly from the tumor. This method avoids detection of mutations that are in a minimal part of tumor cells that are neither biologically nor clinically meaningful (at least for sensitizing mutations).  Our study shows that large-scale routine EGFR analysis is feasible. Indeed, the failure rate is low and the two most frequently mutated exons (19 and 21) could be sequenced in >93 % of patients. Failure in the analysis of exons 18 and 20 occurred in about 13 % of patients. Overall, 132 samples (16.7 %) had no whole-exon 18\\u201321 sequencing. This work shows comparable or better results than those from clinical trials [16, 17]. For example, in First-SIGNAL [16], EGFR mutations were assessable in only 31 % of the patients enrolled; however, we do not know if this was due to a failure of technique or the lack of tissue. In the IPASS study, the failure rate was 23 % (437/565 patients were evaluable) [17]. Our results also highlight that bone samples are not the best material to use for good-quality DNA extraction. Indeed, the decalcification process, in which acidic solution is used, is known to damage DNA [18, 19]. This point is noteworthy and the clinician should either avoid this kind of sample or ask the pathologist to use EDTA-based decalcification (e.g., 13 % EDTA, pH 7.4), in order to permit latter DNA amplification. Actually, all processes that lower the pH of the sample should be avoided. Also, samples should be quickly fixed in buffered formalin. These points show that good communication between clinician, pathologist, and biologist is needed. The clinician is the only one to have clinical information and thus has sole responsibility for requesting this analysis [20]. On the other hand, the pathologist plays a crucial role in the processing and selection of sample slides to send to the biologist in order to have the best-quality DNA and to decrease the rate of indeterminate or failed reports.  We found a high overall EGFR mutation rate. However, it should be kept in mind that this series occurred during the first year of routine analysis of EGFR mutation in France. Consequently, many cases were extracted from archives by clinicians and sent for analysis. It comprises mainly selected patients who had long survival, never smoked, and were young. Consequently, the mutation rate is falsely increased during this first year. In 2010, the EGFR mutation rate in France was 10.5 % [21] and in 2011 the mutation rate in our lab was 11.6 % (106/915). Moreover, as shown later, the screening of exons 18 and 20, which is not common, increased our overall mutation rate. As expected, the two most common mutations are sensitizing mutations in exons 19 and 21. However, the rate of exon 19 mutations is high. Interestingly, the rate of exon 21 mutations did not change after the first year but the number of exon 19 mutations dropped. Likewise, we found a high rate of resistance mutations, perhaps because exon 20 was systematically sequenced in our study. However, the rate of exon 20 mutations fell after the first year and was 1.4 % (13/915) in 2011. Our results also showed that exon 18 mutations are uncommon. Furthermore, the systematic screening of the whole TK encoding region allowed identification of rare (n = 3) or not described (n = 16) mutations. Actually, we found several cases with multiple mutations that, interestingly, were always found on the same allele. This finding could indicate that these mutations cooperate to activate the same protein.  Trials in other countries have studied EGFR analysis prospectively. Nevertheless, none has assessed it in a routine setting to our knowledge. In Spain, among the 2,105 patients who were screened, 350 (16.7 %) had an exon 19 deletion or L858R substitution [22]. In a study conducted in Portugal using high-resolution melting and/or direct sequencing of exons 18\\u201321, a total of 42 patients were found to have a mutation (16.9 %) [23]. Finally, 220 Indian patients were tested for 29 somatic mutations located in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the EGFR gene using a Scorpion probe-based ARMS-PCR technique. The mutation rate in this population was 51.8 % [24].  In this study, patient characteristics were recorded retrospectively. We chose to collect the full data set only for patients with a mutation, which allowed an excellent response rate (100 %). Indeed, our primary objective was to assess the impact of routine EGFR analysis in lung cancer management and the outcome in \\u201cpositive\\u201d patients, not to assess the efficacy of TKI versus other treatment or to reassess the clinical criteria linked to EGFR mutation nor explore physicians\\u2019 knowledge about metastatic lung cancer treatment. However, our data are in agreement with the current knowledge: mutations are more common among females, never-smokers, and patients with adenocarcinomas. Since this work is the first to deal with clinical outcomes in patients with mutations in a routine setting, some of the findings are original. First, only 70 % of patients with mutations received TKI. This is explained partly by the fact that only 77.4 % (n = 103) patients had a known sensitizing mutation. Very few unknown or resistance mutations were treated with TKI. Very few patients (n = 19) did not receive TKI treatment although it should be beneficial. Furthermore, as discussed above, some mutations were found in patients with localized disease who relapsed or in patients with metastatic disease who had already undergone an effective treatment. This fact, which is related to our retrospective design, explains why many patients with mutations underwent TKI in second line instead of first line or did not have the chance up to that time to receive TKI.  There is no difference in median PFS with respect to the location of the mutation on exon 19 or 21. However, patients with exon 18 mutations have a worse survival. This observation may be explained by a differential sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors as described in several studies [25, 26]. Exon 18 point mutations, such as G719S located in the ATP binding loop, are less sensitive to TKI. Indeed, changing from glycine to serine may disrupt the local fine structure and induce a less favorable conformation for gefitinib to bind [26]. Finally, several studies have shown that TKI in first or second line has comparable efficacy in patients with mutations [22, 27, 28]. Our work had similar results, with 14 months of PFS in the first-line TKI group compared to 13 months in the second-line group (p = 0.8). However, this result should be taken with caution since each group included both erlotinib and gefitinib treatment. Finally, the retrospective design of our study makes its finding relatively speculative since our population is subject to several biases (e.g., observation and selection bias). Therefore, survival data should be interpreted with caution.  In France, EGFR analysis prescriptions should follow guidelines [20]. Even though we did not specifically look for compliance with these recommendations, the fact that 15.7 % of mutations were found in stage I\\u2013IIIA patients obviously shows that guidelines are not scrupulously followed in routine practice. Thus, this finding stresses the need for better education of physicians although this behavior could also be attributed to the \\u201cbeing up-to-date\\u201d effect.  Conclusion Our study shows that EGFR mutation research is feasible in routine practice. The molecular centers network in France, supported by the INCa, is a unique and stimulating tool for physicians. It helps fight inequalities in access to molecular testing and targeted therapy and demonstrates that molecular tumor analysis for therapeutic decisions can be successfully integrated into the health-care system [29]. However, this strategy should be closely evaluated and assessed. To this end, the \\u201cBiomarqueur France\\u201d study, funded by INCa and promoted by the French Intergroup IFCT, is ongoing. This study aims to systematically register samples analyzed in each of the tumor molecular biology centers. Clinical data are collected directly by physicians whereas molecular results for EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and EML4-ALK analysis are directly reported by biologists. More than 17,000 patients are expected in one year and results are expected in 2014. Purpose: Mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can be used to predict the tumor response of patients receiving gefitinib for non\\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the association between mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase domain and tumor response and survival in gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients.  Experimental Design: EGFR mutations in exons 18 to 21 were analyzed by DNA sequencing of paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients. The results were correlated with clinical variables.  Results: EGFR mutations were found in 61.1% (33 of 54) of cases; response rate and disease control rate were 56.8% and 68.5%, respectively. There was no significant difference in mutation rates between adenocarcinoma (29 of 43) and nonadenocarcinoma (4 of 11; P = 0.085). However, all four nonadenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations had no response to gefitinib. Presence of EGFR mutations was the only independent predictor for disease control (P = 0.003) and tumor response (P = 0.017) in multivariate analysis; positive predictive values were 87.9% and 70.8% and negative predictive values were 61.9% and 69.2%, respectively. In comparison with patients whose tumor was negative for EGFR mutations, patients with EGFR mutations had better progression-free survival (median, 7.6 versus 1.7 months; P = 0.011) and overall survival (median, 14.7 versus 4.7 months; P = 0.046).  Conclusions: Mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase correlate with treatment response and survival in gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients and can be used as a predictive and prognostic factor. Thus, analysis of EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations in lung adenocarcinoma is of clinical significance, as it can permit the customization of treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in many countries, including Taiwan (1\\u20134). Only a small proportion of lung cancer patients present with localized disease that can be effectively treated with conventional therapy. The overall 5-year survival rate of non\\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is <15%, indicating the highly malignant nature of this disease.  Protein tyrosine kinases play important roles in the pathogenesis of many malignant tumors (5). Among them, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, the first receptor protein tyrosine kinase described, has been implicated in the initiation and progression of NSCLC (6\\u20138). Monoclonal antibodies and small molecular weight compounds that inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway have been developed and shown to have antitumor effects (9).  Gefitinib, a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is an orally active agent for advanced NSCLC. In two phase II trials, IDEAL 1 and IDEAL 2 (10, 11), gefitinib was shown to have substantial effect when used alone as salvage treatment for patients treated previously with chemotherapy. In Taiwan, where Chinese descendants represent a major proportion of the population, we have shown previously a tumor response rate of 33% (12). This outcome was higher than that observed in Caucasian patients but similar to that of Japanese patients (10, 11). These observations suggest ethnic or geographic differences in the response of NSCLC patients to gefitinib treatment. Recently, Lynch et al. (13) and Paez et al. (14) reported that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR play a critical role in determining tumor response in NSCLC patients receiving gefitinib. Interestingly, one of these studies also showed a significant difference in the prevalence of EGFR mutations between Caucasian (2-8%) and Japanese (26%) NSCLC patients (14). Although EGFR mutations have been shown to be strongly associated with the response of NSCLC patients to gefitinib treatment, their role in response duration and patient survival is still unclear, especially in a population that has a higher rate of gefitinib response.  Using pretreatment tumor samples, we have conducted a retrospective study to detect mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene and investigated the relationship between EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations and clinical outcome in 54 Taiwanese NSCLC patients.  Materials and Methods  Patient selection and clinical data collection. Advanced NSCLC patients (n = 146) were treated with gefitinib in a clinical study at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) from March 2002 to February 2004. Patient eligibility for study participation was histologically or cytologically confirmed, inoperable NSCLC, irrespective of the presence of measurable lesions or good performance status. Selected patients had failed prior platinum-based chemotherapy or had a poor performance status at diagnosis and were considered at high risk for conventional chemotherapy. Patients with a life expectancy of <1 week were excluded. Patients were treated with a 250 mg fixed daily dose of gefitinib [Iressa (ZD1839), AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE] as monotherapy. Treatment continued until there was intolerable toxicity, disease progression, or death. All patients gave written informed consent. The treatment protocol was approved by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital Institutional Review Board.  Histopathology review and DNA preparation. Histopathology slides of specimens from bronchoscopic, computed tomography\\u2013guided, or sonography-guided biopsy, wedge resection, or lobectomy were reviewed. Tumors were classified according to the 1999 WHO Histological Typing (15) and staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual (16). Genomic DNA was prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of tumor specimens using xylene deparaffinization, proteinase K digestion, and phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. An alternative DNA extraction method using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for larger size specimens. Extracted DNA was evaluated by UV spectrophotometry and PCR of \\u03b2-globin gene.  PCR and sequencing of EGFR gene from genomic DNA. Eight pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify exons 18 to 21 of EGFR gene by nested PCR according to the previously described procedures (13). PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and the ABI PRISM 3700 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences of PCR amplicons were compared with the cDNA sequence of EGFR obtained from Genbank (accession no. NM 005228.3) by Mutation Surveyor 2.03 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA), Sequencer 4.14 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI), and manual review.  Evaluation for tumor response and patient survival. Pretreatment staging, treatment response, and adverse events were evaluated as described previously (12). Clinical results of the first 76 patients from this study have been published. Objective tumor response was assessed by unidimensional method in accordance with Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors criteria (17). Responses of patients with measurable lesions were classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease; in patients with nonmeasurable lesions, they were classified as nonprogressive disease or progressive disease. Response evaluation was done at the eighth week and every 8 weeks thereafter. In addition, chest X-rays were done on days 8, 15, and 29 and then every 4 weeks. Toxicities were assessed on days 8, 15, and 29 and then every 4 weeks using the WHO toxicity criteria (18), except nail change, which was graded by the modified National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0.  Objective response rate was calculated from patients with measurable lesions and disease control rate was calculated from all patients who had no disease progression at the first response evaluation. Duration of response was calculated from the date of documentation of complete response or partial response to the first instance of disease progression or death. Progression-free survival was calculated from the date of initiation of gefitinib to the date of disease progression or death. Overall survival was defined as the period from the start of gefitinib treatment to the date of death.  Statistical analyses of clinical data and epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Univariate analysis of patient characteristics and tumor response was done by the \\u03c72 test and the Fisher's exact test. The considered variables were age (\\u226465 or >65 years), gender, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 or \\u22652), smoking (ex-smoker/current smoker or nonsmoker), histology (adenocarcinoma or nonadenocarcinoma), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (0, 1, or \\u22652), number of metastatic organs (0/1 or \\u22652), and EGFR mutation (mutant or nonmutant). Logistic regression model with a backward stepwise procedure was used for multivariate analysis. Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. For ordinal variables, a log-rank test of trend was applied. Cox regression model with a backward stepwise procedure was done for multivariate survival analysis. The association between the response and toxicity profile was analyzed using the maximal grade of toxicity experienced during the first month of treatment (early toxicity profile). Analyses and figures were carried out with SPSS for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).  Results  Patient characteristics. Of the 146 patients enrolled for gefitinib treatment, 62 had no available tumor tissue samples, 21 had only limited samples that precluded research analysis, and 9 provided specimens that yielded inadequate DNA for analysis. Consequently, tumor tissue samples that were adequate for DNA analysis were available in 54 patients. In this study, there were similar numbers of male and female patients. Most patients were nonsmokers (66.7%) and had adenocarcinoma (79.6%). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median follow-up was 16.1 months (range, 5.1-24.5 months); 42 patients had progressive disease and 33 patients died.  View inlineView popup Table 1. Patient characteristics (N = 54) Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Thirty-three of the 54 patients (61.1%) had mutations in exons 18 to 21 of EGFR gene. As summarized in Table 2, 12 patients had deletion mutations, 19 had substitution mutations, 1 had combined deletion and substitution mutations, and 1 had double substitution mutations. All but one deletion mutation were found in exon 19 and all substitution mutations were found in exons other than 19. The frequency of mutations in exons 18 to 21 was 9%, 22%, 9%, and 24%, respectively. Deletions in exon 19 (n = 11) and substitution mutation of L858R (n = 9) in exon 21 were the two most common types of mutations, representing 61% of total cases. Other types of mutations were found in one patient each and, with the exception of L861Q and G719S (13, 14), were unreported previously. We identified one deletion mutation and four substitution mutations but no duplication/insertion mutations in exon 20.  View inlineView popup Table 2. Clinical features and mutation patterns in 33 NSCLC patients with mutated EGFR gene Association between epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and patient characteristics. In the univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant association between EGFR mutations and age (\\u226465 versus >65 years, 60.0% versus 62.5%; P = 1.000), gender (male versus female, 51.7% versus 72.0%; P = 0.213), smoking status (nonsmoker versus ex-smoker/current smoker, 69.4% versus 44.4%; P = 0.139), and histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma versus nonadenocarcinoma, 67.4% versus 36.4%; P = 0.085). None of the patients fulfilled the criteria of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) by the 1999 WHO Histological Typing. We estimated the proportion of bronchioloalveolar growth pattern in each adenocarcinoma specimen with a 10% increment scale. Accordingly, we did a subgroup analysis and found that neither the presence nor the proportion of BAC pattern of adenocarcinoma correlated with EGFR mutations (data not shown).  There was no statistically significant difference in demographic characteristics between patients with EGFR deletion mutations and patients with EGFR substitution mutations (data not shown).  Association between epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and tumor response. A total of 37 patients had measurable lesions and 17 had nonmeasurable lesions. Of the 37 patients with measurable lesions, 21 had partial response, 7 had stable disease, and 9 had progressive disease. The objective response rate was 56.8% (95% confidence interval, 40.0-73.5%). In univariate analysis, histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma versus nonadenocarcinoma, 70.0% versus 0%; P = 0.001) and EGFR mutations (mutant versus nonmutant, 70.8% versus 30.8%; P = 0.045) were significantly associated with tumor response. In multivariate analysis, presence of EGFR mutations was the only independent variable in predicting tumor response (P = 0.017; Table 3).  View inlineView popup Table 3. Multivariate regression model in tumor response and patient survival In further analysis of the tumor response in patients with different patterns of EGFR mutations, patients with mutations in exon 18 (4 of 4, 100%) and exon 19 (6 of 7, 85.7%) seemed to have better tumor response rates in comparison with patients with mutations in exon 20 (2 of 4, 50%) and exon 21 (5 of 8, 62.5%; Table 4).  View inlineView popup Table 4. Objective tumor response in patients with EGFR mutations in different exons Of the 17 patients with nonmeasurable lesions, 9 had nonprogressive disease and 8 had progressive disease. Therefore, 37 of the total 54 patients had their disease controlled at the first response evaluation and the disease control rate was 68.5% (95% confidence interval, 55.7-81.3%). Gender (female versus male, 88.0% versus 51.7%; P = 0.010), histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma versus nonadenocarcinoma, 79.1% versus 27.3%; P = 0.002), and EGFR mutations (mutant versus nonmutant, 87.9% versus 38.1%; P < 0.001) were all correlated with disease control. In multivariate analysis, presence of EGFR mutations (P = 0.003) was the only independent predictor again (Table 3).  Of the 33 patients with tumors positive for mutant EGFR, 4 patients had disease progression within 2 months of gefitinib treatment. All these tumors were squamous cell carcinoma and the patterns of mutation were delA767_V769 (exon 20), A763V mutation (exon 20), L858R mutation (exon 21), and a double substitution mutation, G719S and L861Q, in exons 18 and 21.  Table 4 shows the tumor responses of patients with or without EGFR mutations. With respect to EGFR mutations in exons 18 to 21, the positive predictive values were 88% (29 of 33) and 71% (17 of 24) and the negative predictive values were 62% (13 of 21) and 69% (9 of 13) for disease control and tumor response, respectively.  Association between epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and patient survival and response duration. Using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, patients with EGFR mutation had a significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 7.6 versus 1.7 months; P = 0.001; Fig. 1A). Additionally, female gender (P = 0.035), old age (P = 0.035), and adenocarcinoma (P < 0.001) all favored a longer progression-free survival. In Cox regression model with a backward stepwise procedure, histologic subtype (P < 0.001), EGFR status (P = 0.013), age (P = 0.007), and performance status (P = 0.008) were all independent predictors for a longer progression-free survival. In univariate analysis of overall survival, patients with good performance status (P = 0.002), adenocarcinoma (P = 0.012), or mutated EGFR (P = 0.046) had a longer survival (Fig. 1B). In multivariate analysis, only performance status (P = 0.001) and histologic subtype (P = 0.002) were independent predictors (Table 3).  Fig. 1.

Kaplan-Meier plots of progression-free survival (A), overall survival (B), and duration of response (C) in patients with mutant versus nonmutant EGFR. Kaplan-Meier plots of duration of response in patients with EGFR mutation in exons 18, 19, and 21 versus exon 20 versus nonmutant (D). In 21 patients with objective tumor responses, the median duration of response was 5.8 months. Although there was no statistically significant difference between patients with and without EGFR mutations, there was a trend favoring a longer duration of response in patients with mutations (Fig. 1C). However, duration of response of patients with mutations in exon 20 was relatively worse and very similar to that of patients without EGFR mutation (Fig. 1D). No other variables had a correlation with response duration.  Discussion  In this study, we showed a high EGFR mutation rate in our NSCLC patient population, with mutation patterns very similar to those reported previously (13, 14). We documented that EGFR mutations played a crucial role in determining gefitinib response in NSCLC patients, confirming findings from two previous landmark studies of <20 gefitinib-treated patients (13, 14). For the first time, we have also shown that mutations in EGFR could confer longer survival in gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients. Furthermore, of those patients achieving partial response, patients with mutations in EGFR had a trend of longer response durations in comparison with patients lacking EGFR mutations.  Gefitinib has shown antitumor activity in pretreated NSCLC patients with response rates of 10% to 20% (10, 11). From these two phase II clinical studies (10, 11), gefitinib seemed to be more effective in females and patients with adenocarcinoma and a good performance status. In a subsequent Expanded Access Program study, nonsmokers and BAC subtype were also considered as promising predictors of gefitinib response (19). The issue, such as Japanese or non-Japanese patients, was initially considered to be irrelevant by the multivariate regression model (10). However, accumulated clinical evidence strongly suggests that ethnic/geographic factors play an important role in the response of patients to gefitinib treatment. This is based on the high response rates reported exclusively from countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Taiwan (12, 20, 21). Although the similarity of high response rates (\\u223c30%) among each independent group in this region was quite convincing, most of these data came from observational studies with no supporting molecular analyses. However, two studies recently showed a strong association between EGFR mutations and gefitinib response (13, 14). Additionally, the prevalence of EGFR mutations in NSCLC was strikingly higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, and the figures were close to the previously reported gefitinib response rates in these two patient populations (10). This was the first genetic evidence supporting the theory of ethnic/geographic differences in the response of NSCLC patients to treatment with gefitinib.  All patients in our study were Taiwanese and the majority (83%) had been heavily pretreated with chemotherapy. The mutation rate (61.1%) in our study was not only higher than that observed in Caucasian NSCLC patients (\\u223c2%) but also higher than that usually noted in Japanese and Taiwanese (\\u223c40%) treatment-naive NSCLC patients (13, 14, 22, 23) and was most likely due to the skewed population. In comparison to the lung cancer patient population demographics of Taiwan, there was a high proportion of female (46% versus 30%) patients and patients with no previous history of smoking (67% versus 40%) in this study\\u2014both of these factors could be associated with a higher EGFR mutation rate (14, 19, 24). The most likely reason for the skewed demographics was the \\u201cselection effect\\u201d of prior chemotherapy. It was well documented that females and nonsmokers have better prognosis translating to improved survival when treated by systemic chemotherapy (25, 26). This would thus result in a tendency to include more females and nonsmokers in studies evaluating the second-line and post-second-line treatment.  A retrospective study has shown better response rates in patients with BAC (19) and some groups have implied that BAC might have a different biology (27). In this study, none of the patients fulfilled the criteria of BAC by the 1999 WHO Histological Typing. Nevertheless, we calculated the BAC proportion in each adenocarcinoma specimen and did a subgroup analysis in these patients. We did not find any statistical difference of BAC proportion in the frequency of EGFR mutations, objective tumor response rate, or disease control rate. Accordingly, at least in our Taiwanese patient population, we did not observe evidence supporting a difference in gefitinib response among tumors with varied BAC components (data not shown).  In our 33 patients with EGFR mutations, 11 had deletions in exon 19, 9 had a substitution mutation at L858R in exon 21, 10 had variable types of single-nucleotide substitution mutations in exon 18, 20, or 21, 1 had deletion in exon 20, 1 had double substitution mutations in exons 18 and 21, and 1 had combined deletion in exon 19 and substitution mutation in exon 20. The patterns of EGFR mutations were quite complex and this finding was similar to a previous report from this area (23).  To the best of our knowledge, in a total of 212 published cases with EGFR mutation (13, 14, 22\\u201324), only 3 cases were nonadenocarcinoma: 2 were adenosquamous cell carcinomas and 1 was large cell carcinoma. None of these three cases had received gefitinib treatment; therefore, the clinical significance was unknown. In this study, we found four nonadenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations and all were squamous cell carcinomas. The mutation patterns were A763V, L858R, N826S, and delL747_P753insS in one each. Patients with the former two mutations had progressive disease after gefitinib treatment; the latter two had stable disease with a relatively shorter progression-free survival (6.7 and 2.4 months, respectively). In 29 patients with adenocarcinoma bearing EGFR mutation, 17 had partial response, 9 had nonprogressive disease, 1 had stable disease, and only 2 had progressive disease. In contrast, none of our seven patients with nonadenocarcinoma had gefitinib response, irrespective of their tumor EGFR mutation status. This finding of the lack of predictive value of EGFR mutation in lung squamous cell carcinoma needs to be confirmed.  Among 212 published cases with EGFR mutation, 33 patients who had EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 had been treated with gefitinib or erlotinib and only 1 case showed no tumor response. The mutation in that case resulted in a stop codon and therefore truncated EGFR protein (23), thus explaining the failure of gefitinib treatment. In our study, 4 of 33 patients with mutated EGFR had progressive disease after gefitinib treatment. The patterns of EGFR mutation included delA767_V769, double substitution mutation (G719S and L861Q), A763V, and L858R in one each. Both delA767_V769 and A763V were in exon 20 and these two patterns are unreported previously. Substitution mutations at L858R and L861Q have both been associated with gefitinib response in previous reports (13, 23). Substitution mutation of G719S has been reported but not in gefitinib-treated patient (14, 22). Although Lynch et al. (13) had reported one gefitinib responder with G719C mutation, the association between G719S and gefitinib response is unknown. Further study is required to clarify the association between the sites and patterns of mutation and the treatment response, especially in exon 20.  In the present study, we used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue for mutational analysis of EGFR gene. The fragmentation of DNA may lower the yield of the PCR reactions but does not compromise the accuracy of sequencing. In a recent study from Taiwan (23), the authors analyzed 16 paraffin-embedded tumor tissues and 50% of the specimens had EGFR mutations. They also did mutation analyses on freshly frozen specimens of 69 adenocarcinoma cases and found a similar mutation rate (55.1%). We consider DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues to be as adequate and suitable for mutational analysis as that extracted from freshly frozen tissues.  In this study, there were two findings that were somewhat contradictory to previous reports. First, a high mutation rate (40%) was found in squamous cell carcinomas. Although the histologic typing of these tumors had been blindly reviewed and confirmed by two other pathologists, this result should be carefully interpreted due to the limited number of cases. Second, there was no difference in EGFR mutation rates between patients who were current smokers or ex-smokers and those who had no previous history of smoking. However, this finding concurred with a recent report of EGFR mutational analysis in 101 unselected, non-gefitinib-treated NSCLC in Taiwan (23). Ongoing investigations will determine if factors other than a history of smoking, for example, exposure to viruses or fumes from cooking oils (28, 29), play a role in EGFR mutations and are involved in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinomas.  Gene amplification plays an important role in the pathogenesis in several types of cancer and frequently precedes and may favor the occurrence of mutations (30). However, the association between EGFR gene amplification and gefitinib response is unknown. EGFR gene amplification was observed in 34% of glioblastoma; however, no objective tumor response was noted in a phase II trial of gefitinib (31). Similarly, increased EGFR gene copy number was evident in 60% of NSCLC, but the response rate to gefitinib was only 10% to 20% in the corresponding group of patients (32). EGFR gene amplification may create a predisposition to EGFR mutations but, as a single factor, it seems to be unrelated to the gefitinib tumor response.  Although the frequency of EGFR mutations in our selected group of patients was relatively higher at 61.1%, we have confirmed that EGFR mutations correlated with a better response to gefitinib treatment as illustrated by response rate (56.8%) and patient survival.  Cell type, mutation status of EGFR, and performance status but not the number of prior chemotherapy regimen was associated with gefitinib response of NCSLC patients (12). When compared with currently available front-line chemotherapy, gefitinib showed much higher treatment efficacy in adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations (85%) and comparable efficacy in adenocarcinomas with no EGFR mutations (\\u223c40%). EGFR mutations had no predictive value in patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma.  Based on the above findings, we suggest that sequencing of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain in lung adenocarcinoma patients, at least those of East Asian origin, would be of clinical significance and permit the customization of treatment using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors as front-line treatment in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic settings. 1. Introduction Lung cancer is a major cause of death from malignant diseases, due to its high incidence, malignant behavior and lack of major advancements in treatment strategy [1]. There are much accumulated evidences that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its family members are strongly implicated in the development and progression of numerous human tumors, including lung cancer [2] ;  [3]. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, was approved in Japan for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since 2002. Original two reports showed that EGFR mutations statuses at ATP binding pockets in NSCLC patients were correlated with the clinico-pathological features related to good response to gefitinib [4] ;  [5]. These EGFR mutations are predominantly found in Japanese lung cancer patients (about 25\\u201340%) [4]; [6]; [7]; [8] ;  [9] when compared to USA patients (about 8\\u201310%) [4]; [5]; [7] ;  [10] or European patients [7] ;  [11]. Actually, EGFR mutations in lung cancer have been correlated with clinical response to gefitinib therapy in vivo and in vitro [4]; [5] ;  [10]. Although many EGFR mutations have been reported, not all have been associated with responsiveness to gefitinib. The two most common EGFR mutations that have been identified, representing 85\\u201390% of EGFR mutations, are the EGFR exon 19 deletion that eliminates a leucine\\u2013arginine\\u2013glutamate\\u2013alanine motif in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR and a thymine to guanine transversion that results in an arginine for leucine substitution at amino acid 858 (L858R). These two mutants responded significantly better for gefitinib therapy than other types of mutants [12] ;  [13]. However, Greulich et al. showed transformation by an exon 20 insertion, made cells resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib [14]. To determine the EGFR mutation status and correlation with clinico-pathological features in Japanese lung carcinoma, we investigated exon 20 insertion mutation status by direct sequences. The findings were compared to the clinico-pathological features of lung cancer.  2. Material and methods 2.1. Patients  The study group included 295 lung cancer patients who had undergone surgery at the Department of Surgery II, Nagoya City University Medical School between 1994 and 2005. We have also investigated EGFR mutation status for 27 lung cancer patients who had undergone surgery followed by treated with gefitinib at the National Hospital Organization, Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center. Gefitinib was used after lung cancer recurrence, and clinical outcome was shown in reference [9]. The lung tumors were classified according to the general rule for clinical and pathological record of lung cancer in Japan [15]. All tumor samples were immediately frozen and stored at \\u221280 \\u00b0C until assayed. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients, and the institutional ethics committee of the Nagoya City University Medical School approved the study.  2.2. PCR assays for EGFR mutations  Genomic DNA was extracted using Wizard SV Genomic DNA Purification Systems (Promega) according to the manufacturers\\u2019 instructions. The primers for exon 20 sequencing were designed with Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primer sets used in the assay are: forward ACTTCACAGCCCTGCGTAAAC, and reverse: ATGGGACAGGCACTGATTTGT. The sequence results of exon 20 about 131 of 322 cases were already reported [4] ;  [16]. The cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 \\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 \\u00b0C for 30 s, 64 \\u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \\u00b0C for 60 s. The products were purified by Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Amplified cDNAs were separated on 1% agarose gels, and the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet transillumination. These samples were sequenced by ABI prism 3100 analyzer (Applied Biosystems Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed by BLAST and chromatograms by manual review form forward and reverse, both side.  2.3. Statistical analysis  Statistical analyses were done using the Mann\\u2013Whitney U-test for unpaired samples and Wilcoxon's singed rank test for paired samples. Linear relationships between variables were determined by means of simple linear regression. Correlation coefficients were determined by rank correlation using Spearman's test and \\u03c72 test. The overall survival of lung cancer patients was examined by the Kaplan\\u2013Meier methods, and differences were examined by the Log-rank test. All analysis was done using the Stat-View software package (Abacus Concepts Inc. Berkeley, CA), and was considered significant when the p-value was less than 0.05.  3. Results 3.1. EGFR gene mutation status in Japanese lung cancer patients  The clinical and pathological characteristics of the 322 lung cancer patients are as follows: 234 (72.7%) were males and 88 were females. Two hundred and five (63.7%) were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, and 117 were diagnosed as other types of carcinoma. Two hundred and thirty-one (71.7%) were smokers and 90 were non-smokers (one unknown). Of 295 lung cancer patients from Nagoya City University, 167 (56.6%) were stage I.  Most of the sequencing results about exon 18, 19 and 21 were already reported [4]; [16] ;  [17]. In exon 19, 18 patients had the deletion type mutation. In exon 18 or exon 21, 29 patients had the missense point mutations (2 G719S, 1 G719C, 25 L858R and 1 L861Q). Of these 47 patients, 17 were males and 30 were females. Thirty were non-smokers and 17 were smokers. Forty-three patients had adenocarcinoma, one had squamous cell carcinoma and three had adenosquamous cell carcinoma. Thus EGFR mutation status at exon 18, 19 or 21 was significantly correlated with gender (p < 0.0001), tobacco-smoking (p < 0.0001) and pathological subtypes (adenocarcinoma versus non-adenocarcinoma, p < 0.0001).  For exon 20, 7 patients had the insertion mutations (Table 1). These mutations were exclusively associated with other EGFR mutation. Three were males and four were females. Four were non-smokers and three were smokers. Six patients had adenocarcinoma and one had squamous cell carcinoma. Two were moderately differentiated, and four were well differentiated (one unclassified). There was a tendency towards higher exon 20 insertion mutation ratio in never smoker (never smoker 4.4% versus smoker 1.3%, p = 0.0996) and female (female 4.5% versus male 1.3%, p = 0.0917). Two female patients had 774_776 insertion NPH (2320-2328 insertion AACCCCCAC) mutations reported as D7 mutation by Shigematsu et al. (Fig. 1) [7]. A female patient had 770_772 insertion ASV (2308-2316 insertion GCCAGCGTG) mutation reported as D1 mutation by Shigematsu et al. [7]. A male patient had 771_773 insertion SVD (2311-19 insertion GCGTGGACA) mutation reported by Sonobe et al. [18]. A male patient had 772_773 insertion V (2312-14 insertion GGT) reported by Thomas et al. [19]. Two patients had 772_773insertion N (2312-14 insertion AAC) mutations (Fig. 1).  Table 1.

Relationship between clinical course of patients with lung cancer and EGFR mutations  The overall survival of 322 lung cancer patients with follow-up through December 30, 2006, was studied in reference to the EGFR mutation status. The prognosis from patients with exon 20 insertion mutation (n = 7, 2 were dead) and the patient without exon 20 insertion mutation EGFR (n = 315, 102 were dead) was not significantly different (Log-rank test, p = 0.7186, Breslow\\u2013Gehan\\u2013Wilcoxon test, p = 0.8593) (Fig. 2). Eighteen patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (five were with cisplatin base, seven were with calboplatin base and six were with Uracil-Ftegafur). Even if the 18 patients were excluded for survival analysis, the prognosis from patients with exon 20 mutation and without mutation was not significantly different (p = 0.7215).

Three years later, the recurrent lung cancer was treated with gemcitabine, vinorelbine and Uracil-Ftegafur in addition to radiotherapy. Because the treatment failed, gefitinib treatment was started at 2004. The patient died from progressive disease about 6 months after gefitinib administration.

Figure options 4. Discussion We obtained findings that exon 20 insertion type EGFR mutations tend to be higher in female gender and never smoker, as like as other EGFR mutation subtypes [8]; [9]; [10]; [11]; [12]; [13] ;  [14]. From the original three papers published by Lynch et al., Paez et al. and Pao et al., there was no EGFR exon 20 insertion subtypes. Shigematsu et al. reported that 12 of 617 (1.9%) had exon 20 insertion mutation, however, 356 of 617 patients were either from Japan or Taiwan [11]. Sonobe et al. reported that the 2 of 154 cases (1.3%) had EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. These data suggested that EGFR mutations at exon 20 might be also higher in East Asian. More interestingly, patients with exon 20 mutation did not respond to gefitinib therapy.  Although many reports have identified more than 30 different mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains of EGFR, the vast majority of which can be grouped into three major types, including in-frame deletion at exon 19, single-nucleotide substitution at exon 18 or 21 and in-frame duplication at exon 20 [8]; [9]; [10]; [11]; [12]; [13] ;  [14]. To date, only the L858R missense mutation in exon 21 and deletions in exon 19 have been proven to be activating mutations [4]; [5]; [10] ;  [14]. On the other hands, Greulich et al. reported that transformation by the D770_N771 ins NPG (exon 20) EGFR insertion mutant was remarkably insensitive to gefitinib and erlotinib, as inhibition of colony growth in soft agar required exposure to 100-fold higher concentrations (>1 mM) of these agents than was required to inhibit colony formation by cells expressing the EGFR missense mutants or deletion mutant [14]. No significant inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of cells expressing D770_N771ins NPG EGFR was observed at 3 mM gefitinib or erlotinib [14]. Greulich et al. also reported that all three lung adenocarcinoma patients with known exon 20 insertion mutants of EGFR have failed to show a clinical response to treatment and have instead achieved only stable disease with erlotinib [14]. In vitro analysis, cells expressing the EGFR deletion and insertion mutants formed colonies in soft agar with a higher efficiency than that of cells expressing the missense mutants, comparable to the colony formation efficiency of cells expressing polyoma middle T antigen, suggested these mutants were oncogenic [14]. Interestingly, the irreversible EGFR inhibitor CL-387, 785 [20] is more effective than gefitinib or erlotinib for inhibition of colony formation by cells expressing the exon 20 insertion mutant [14]. CL-387, 785 had an even greater effect on colony formation by cells expressing L858R [14], and this compound was previously found to be active against EGFR containing the exon 20 point mutation T790M, associated with resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib [21]. Thus the distinct inhibitor sensitivity of various EGFR mutants argues that therapies may need to be targeted against specific mutant forms of a protein, whereas generalized inhibition of a particular oncogenic target may not be sufficient.\",\n          \"An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene is found in nearly 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5% of myelodysplastic syndrome cases. Our serial studies on 51 samples with the FLT3 gene mutation indicated that the ITD was frequently (47/51) clustered in the tyrosine-rich stretch from codon 589 to 599 and rarely (3/51) in its downstream region, both of which are located within the juxtamembrane (JM) domain. One remaining sample had an insertion into the JM domain of nucleotides of unknown origin. To eludicate the biological relevance of the ITD or the insertion, we expressed various types of mutant FLT3 in Cos 7 cells. All mutant FLT3 studied were ligand-independently dimerized and their tyrosine residues were phosphorylated. The Y589 of FLT3 was essential for the phosphorylation in the wild FLT3, but a Y589F conversion did not affect the phosphorylation status of the mutant FLT3. These findings suggest that the elongation of the JM domain rather than increase of tyrosine residues causes gainof-function of FLT3. Thus, ITD is a novel modality of somatic mutation which activates its product. Since the DNA corresponding to codon 593 to 602 potentially forms a palindromic intermediate, we propose that a DNA-replication error might be associated with generating the ITD of the FLT3 gene. Keywords: tandem duplication; length mutation; FLT3; acute myeloid leukemia; phosphorylation Introduction FLT3, a classs III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), along with KIT, FMS and PDGF-R, has an extracellular region composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane region, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, two tyrosine kinase domains (TK1 and TK2) spaced by a kinase insert domain, and a C-terminal domain.1,2 FLT3 is preferentially expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors in addition to the central nervous system, placenta and liver.2,3 FLT3 is activated by its ligand (FL) which is expressed as a membrane-bound or soluble form by bone marrow stroma cells.4 FLT3 molecules are dimerized by the FL-binding, and are phosphorylated on its intracellular tyrosine residues. The phosphorylated FLT3 transduces activation signals through association with various cytoplasmic proteins, including RAS GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase C-g, Vav, Shc, Cbl, Grb2 and Src family tyrosine kinases.5\\u20137 Most clinical samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) also express FLT3. Exogenous FL stimulates the proliferation of AML cells rather than ALL cells, although the mechanism of different responsiveness has been little elucidated.7,8 Recently, an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 Correspondence: T Naoe, Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan; Fax: 81 52 744 2801 Received 19 May 1998; accepted 25 May 1998 gene (FLT3/ITD) was found in AML.9 In FLT3/ITD, a fragment of the JM domain-coding sequence, which primarily consisted of exon 11 but sometimes included intron 11 and exon 12, was arranged as a direct head-to-tail succession. Its location and length varied from sample to sample, but the duplicated sequence was always in frame.9\\u201311 Thus, mutant FLT3 contained a long JM domain although other domains were unaffected. Clinically, FLT3/ITD was observed in nearly 20% of de novo AML cases regardless of the French\\u2013American\\u2013British (FAB) classification and in 5% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases.11 Its presence was related to leukocytosis in the M3 subtype of AML.10 FLT3/ITD emerged during progression of MDS12 or at relapse of AML (unpublished data), suggesting an association with leukemia progression rather than initiation. Although FLT3/ITD is one of the most frequent gene mutations found in acute myeloid leukemia, mutant FLT3 products and their biological significance have not been characterized. In this study, we summarized the FLT3 gene mutations from a total of 51 AML and MDS samples. To elucidate the biological relevance of the mutations, we analyzed the expression and phosphorylation of mutant FLT3 transfected in Cos 7 cells. We showed that elongation of the JM sequence was important to gain-of-function of FLT3. Thus, this is the first report to show that ITD is a novel modality of somatic mutation which elongates the critical sequences of proto-oncogene and activates its product. Materials and methods Leukemia samples and detection of FLT3/ITD High molecular weight DNA was extracted from leukemia cells, and a DNA fragment covering the JM domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described.10 Abnormal sized-bands were cut out from the agarose gel, purified with a Qiaex gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA), and cloned into the pMOSBlue T-vector (Amersham, Bucks, UK) as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten recombinant colonies were chosen and cultured in LB medium. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep spin plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen), and both strands were sequenced using fluorescein-conjugated 21M13 and T7 primers on a DNA sequencer (377; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Expression of the FLT3 transcripts was examined using the reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR (RT-PCR) method as previously described.10 Abnormal-sized products were cloned and sequenced as above to confirm that the transcript was in-frame. Constitutive phosphorylation of mutant FLT3 H Kiyoi et al 1334 Analysis of transfectants A MunI\\u2013EcoRV fragment covering the tandem repeat of the mutated FLT3 cDNA was amplified from leukemia cells by RT-PCR using the following primer pairs: MunI-F (5\\u2032-CAACAATTGGTGTTTGTCTCCTCTT-3\\u2032) and EcoRV-R (5\\u2032-CATGATATCTCGAGCCAATCCAAAG-3\\u2032). Amplified products were digested by a combination of MunI and EcoRV endonucleases (Boehringer Mannheim Yamanouchi, Tokyo, Japan), separated on an agarose gel, and purified as described above. The expression vector pCDHF3, which contains a full-length cDNA of the FLT3 gene, was kindly provided by Dr Oliver Rosnet (INSERM, France). A fragment from the 1640 nt to the 2503 nt was removed by MunI and EcoRV digestion. The purified mutated fragment was cloned into the digested pCDHF3 vector at the MunI and EcoRV sites. Point mutations which changed tyrosine residues Y589 and Y591 to phenylalanine residues were introduced into the wild and mutated FLT3 sequence cloned into the pCDHF3 vector with the oligonucleotides 5\\u2032-CCTCAGATAATGAGTTCTTCTACGTTGATTTCAG-3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032-CTGAAATCAACGTAGAAGAACTCATTATCTGAGG-3\\u2032 for Y589F and 5\\u2032-CCTCAGATAATGAGTACTTCTTCGTTGATTTCAG-3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032-CTGAAATCAACGAAGAAGTACTCATTATCTGAGG-3\\u2032 for Y591F using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The wild and mutated constructs were transfected to Cos 7 cells by Lipofection (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. After 72 h culture, cells were lysed in lysed buffer: 20 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM NaF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM Na2MoO4 and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After incubation for 1 h at 4\\u00b0C, lysates were spun at 15 000 g at 4\\u00b0C for 30 min, and pellets were discarded. To study the effect of FL, cells were stimulated by FL at a concentration of 50 ng/ml for 10 min, then lysed as above. A portion of the lysed samples separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE), and electroblotted on to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4\\u00b0C in 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim Yamanouchi) in 0.1 M maleic acid and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5, and incubated in mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20; Takara, Kyoto, Japan or 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA) for 1 h, then in HRPlabeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 1 h. Signals were developed using ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham). After developing the signal, we incubated the membrane in stripping buffer (62.5 mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 70\\u00b0C for 30 min, and reprobed it with rabbit anti-human FLT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h, then HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (BioRad) for 1 h. The remaining lysates were incubated with anti-FLT3 antibody and precipitated with protein A/G Plusagarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitated samples were separated and electroblotted. The membrane was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, then reprobed with anti-FLT3 antibody as described above. Chemical cross-linking Dimerization of FLT3 was analyzed by chemical cross-linking. Cos 7 cells were transfected with wild and mutated FLT3 as described above, and cultured for 72 h. The transfected cells were incubated with or without FL (50 ng/ml) for 90 min at 4\\u00b0C, and were washed five times in ice-cold PBS. Cross-linking was performed in PBS with BS3 (1 mM) for 30 min at 22\\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine-HCl (pH 7.5) to the final concentration of 150 mM and incubating for 5 min. Sodium orthovanadate (100 mM) was included in all buffers. The cells were lysed, subjected to the SDS-PAGE and blotted on to the membrane as described above. The membrane was incubated in mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 1 h, then in HRPlabeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (BioRad) for 1 h. Signals were developed as described above. After developing the signal, the membrane was incubated in stripping buffer, and reprobed with rabbit anti-human FLT3 antibody. Results Individual variation of FLT3/ITD Through our serial studies on FLT3/ITD, we have sequenced FLT3/ITD from a total of 50 AML and MDS samples. We determined which tyrosine residue(s) (denoted by Y) were involved in ITD, since the JM domain contains a Y-rich stretch, 589YFYVDFREYEY599, associated with signal transduction. In 47 of the 50 samples, all or some of these Y were duplicated in mutant FLT3; most frequently Y589/- Y591/Y597/Y599 followed by Y597/Y599. None of the samples had duplication of the fragment upsteam to Y589, but the downstream fragments were involved in five of the 50 samples. Notably, in one sample which was not reported in our previous studies, a 36-bp insertion of unknown origin was observed in exon 11 (the sequence is presented as Mt6 in Figure 1a). These data are summarized in Table 1. Constitutive activation of mutant FLT3 expressed in Cos 7 cells To analyse the phosphorylation status of mutant FLT3 it was immunoprecipitated from the clinical samples. However, significant signals were not obtained by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Then the wild or the mutant FLT3 cDNA was transfected into Cos 7 cells. Since ITD varied from sample to sample as to position and size, six types of FLT3/ITD were chosen. Mutants 1 to 5 (Mt1\\u2013Mt5) had ITD including Y597/Y599, Y589/Y591/Y597/Y599 (long), Y589/Y591/Y597/- Y599 (short), Y591/Y597/Y599, Y589/Y591/Y597, respectively. Mutant 6 (Mt6) contained the 36 bp insertion of unknown origin (Figure 1a). The wild type of FLT3 was detected as a major band at 130 kDa and a minor band at 155 kDa by immunoblot analysis using total cell lysates (Figure 1b), which corresponds to the published data. Both bands of FLT3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLT3 antibody and detected by immunoblot analysis. The wild type of FLT3 was significantly phosphorylated after the FL-stimulation. Each mutant type of FLT3 was observed as the same size and the same amount of bands as the wild FLT3 by immunoblot analysis using total cell lysates (Figure 1b). However, the anti-FLT3 antibody (anti-C-terminal 20 amino acids) failed to immunoprecipitate FLT3 from Mt1. Other mutant types of FLT3 were also precipitated to a lesser degree than the wild FLT3. These findings suggest that the mutant FLT has a conformational change of its C-terminus region. Constitutive phosphorylation of mutant FLT3 H Kiyoi et al 1335 Figure 1 (a) Amino acid sequences duplicated by FLT3/ITD (Mt1 to Mt5) or inserted (Mt6). Germ line amino acid sequence of the JM is presented at the top. The TK domain starts at 608E. Non-coded amino acids sequences were added between the duplication due to various mechanisms as described previously. (b) Tyrosine-phosphorylation of FLT3 expressed in Cos 7 cells. The wild or the mutant type of FLT3 cDNA was transfected into Cos 7 cells. The lysates were immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLT3 antibody and PA-agarose. The precipitated samples were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLT3 antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot. (c) Constitutive tyrosine-phosphorylation of the wild FLT3 by the co-transfection of the mutant FLT3. The wild and the mutant type of FLT3 were simultaneously transfected into Cos 7 cells. All mutant FLT3 including Mt6 were constitutively phosphorylated in a ligand-independent manner (Figure 1b). These results indicate that FLT3 was constitutively activated by these mutations. To study the effect of the mutant FLT3 on the wild FLT3, both FLT3 cDNA were simultaneously transfected into Cos 7 cells (Figure 1c). Since Mt1 was not immunoprecipitated, ligand-independent phosphorylation in the transfectant indicated the phosphorylation of the wild FLT3. This finding indicates that the wild FLT3 was phosphorylated by the mutant FLT3 expressed in the same cell. Since the dimerization of RTK is known to be a key event for the following activation, we determined whether the ITD or the insertion led to receptor dimerization without FL stimulation. Transfected Cos 7 cells were treated with BS3 that was a hydrophilic cross-linker,13 and FLT3 was detected by immunoblot analysis. An approximate molecular size of 260 kDa that corresponded to a probable homodimer of FLT3 was detected after the FL stimulation (Figure 2). On the other hand, the same sized band was detected in the mutant FLT3 without FL-stimulation. These findings suggest that the ITD or the insertion at the JM domain induced the extracellular dimerization of FLT3 without FL stimulation. Increase of tyrosine residues is unessential for constitutive phosphorylation of FLT3 On comparing the primary structures between FLT3 and PDGFR, the Y589 of FLT3 corresponds to Y579 of PDGF-R, which is known to be phosphorylated by ligand binding.14 Since the phosphorylated Y579 of PDGF-R binds with the SH2 domain of the Src family, Y589 of FLT3 might similarly be associated with signal transduction. Accordingly, we next characterized the role of Y589 and Y591 in the wild or mutant type of FLT3. Using mutated oligonucleotides, Y589 and Y591 were converted to phenylalanine (denoted by Y589F and Y591F, respectively). The ligand-dependent phosphorylation was decreased in a Y589F substitution of wild FLT3, whereas it was rather enhanced in a Y591F substitution (Figure 3a). A series of Y589F substitutions of mutant FLT3 showed constitutive phosphorylation. Similarly, a series of Y591 substitutions did not affect the phosphorylation (Figure 3b). Thus, the increase of Y residues is not necessary and elongation of the JM domain may be more important for constitutive phosphorylation. Discussion In this study, we first summarized the location of FLT3/ITD from a total of 51 AML and MDS samples to assume the biological significance of FLT3/ITD. FLT3/ITD frequently involved either YFY at codons 589 to 591 or YEY at codons 597 to 599, but did not significantly affect the tyrosine-kinase domain. When we compared the primary structures between FLT3 and PDGF-R, we found the Y589 of FLT3 corresponds to Y579 of PDGFR, which is known to be phosphorylated by ligand binding. Since the phosphorylated Y579 of PDGF binds with the SH2 domain of the Src family,14 Y589 of FLT3 might similarly be associated with signal transduction. Thus, one possibility to explain the significance of FLT3/ITD was that FLT3/ITD is associated with the amplification of FLT3 signaling. Another possibility was that FLT3/ITD causes ligand-independent activation of FLT3. Our serial studies indicated that a few samples with FLT3/ITD contain no tyrosine residue, and we also found one sample carrying an insertion of unknown origin sequence into the JM domain. Accordingly, we investigated the latter possibility in this study. The biological significance of the ITD or the nucleotide insertion was elucidated by the Cos 7 expression system. All mutant FLT3 studied were ligand-independently phosphorylated regardless of the location and length of ITD. The mutant FLT3 with the insertion was also constitutively phosphorylated. So far, several kinds of activating mutations have been reported in type III RTKs. Mutations of c-Kit in mast cell neoplasm are notable for their similarity to those of FLT3. Notably, the JM domain was affected; a V559G substitution and a deletion of 7 amino acids.13,15 Both mutant c-Kits were Constitutive phosphorylation of mutant FLT3 H Kiyoi et al 1336 Table 1 Summary of previous studies on the position of FLT3/ITD Position of Y residues involved in FLT3/ITD Nakao Kiyoi Yokota Horiike This study Total et al9 et al10 et al11 et al12 Y589, Y591, Y597, Y599 4 9 2 15 Y589, Y591, Y597, 2 1 3 Y589, Y591, 2131 7 Y589, 0 Y591, Y597, Y599 2 2 Y591, Y597, 0 Y591, 1 1 Y597, Y599 1 5 7 13 Y597, 0 Y599 1 3 2 6 Downstream to Y599 1 1 1 3 Origin unknown 1 1 Total number of samples 5 15 23 7 1 51 Figure 2 Cross-linking experiment. The wild or mutant FLT3 was cross-linked by BS3 and detected by immunoblot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibody. not only autophosphorylated but also dimerized between extracellular domains without ligand stimulation. On the other hand, a D814Y mutation in TK2 domain caused autonomous phosphorylation without dimerization.16 Another member of RTK type III, PDGF, is involved in the t(5;12) translocation found in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The resultant TEL-PDGF fusion product was an activated mutant of PDGF, because TEL-derived sequence contributed to oligomerization of PDGF-derived sequence.17 Thus, the constitutive dimerization is a key mechanism for activating mutation of RTK. FLT3/ITD also seems to cause ligand-independent dimerization of FLT3 for the following reasons. First, since the wild FLT3 was ligand-independently phosphorylated by the simultaneous transfection of the mutant FLT3, the mutant FLT3 must physically associate with the wild FLT3. Second, the crosslinking experiment showed that mutant FLT3 formed a highmolecular complex, presumably a dimer, on cell surface without FL stimulation. The JM domain mutations might induce an extracellular conformational change which favors dimer formation of FLT3. To further confirm that elongation is more important for the constitutive activation than the increase of tyrosine residues, Figure 3 The role of Y589 and Y591 in wild and mutant types of FLT3. The Y589 and Y591 were converted to phenylalanine. The precipitated samples by the anti-FLT3 antibody were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The ligand-dependent phosphorylation was decreased in a Y589F substitution of wild FLT3 (a). A series of Y589F substitutions of mutant FLT3 showed constitutive phosphorylation. Similarly a series of Y591 substitutions did not affect phosphorylation (b). we substituted Y589 or Y591 for phenylalanine. It was shown that a Y589F conversion did not affect the phosphorylation status of the mutant FLT3 in contrast to the wild FLT3. Why then is the ITD clustered around Y597/Y599? What is the molecular mechanism of generating ITD? Generally, when a single-stranded DNA has the potential to form complex secondary structures including hairpins, it may be responsible for replication-based mutations: deletion, addition, frameshift and duplication. That is, hairpin formation of a lagging template or strand causes replication slippage generating DNA deletion or duplication, respectively.18,19 This model has been proposed to account for microsatellite instability in mutator mutants and triplet disease such as inherited neuromuscular disease.20 We suppose it is further applicable to FLT3/ITD for the following reason. According to the sequence data from 50 samples with FLT3/ITD, duplication frequency at each tyrosine codon was as follows: 25/50 (50%) at Y589, 28/50 (56%) Constitutive phosphorylation of mutant FLT3 H Kiyoi et al 1337 Figure 4 (a) Location of the clustered region of FLT3/ITD. The JM domain is partly duplicated and elongated from 6 to 38 (median 15) amino acids by FLT3/ITD, but the other domains including TK domains are not affected. (b) A proposed mechanism for the generation of FLT3/ITD. Single-strand DNA corresponding to D593 to K602 potentially forms a palindromic intermediate. If this occurs in the lagging strand during DNA replication, FLT3/ITD would be generated by replication slippage. Numbers denote the position of amino acids. at Y591, 33/50 (66%) at Y597, 36/50 (72%) at Y599 (Table 1). Additionally, F605 was involved in 22/50 (44%) (data not shown). Accordingly, Y597 and Y599 were most frequently involved in FLT3/ITD. As shown in Figure 4, the DNA corresponding to D593 to K602 potentially forms a palindromic intermediate. If a lagging strand makes a hairpin during DNA replication and the following mismatch repair system is impaired, the tandemly duplicated fragment will be fixed in DNA. If FLT3/ITD occurs in an out-of-frame manner, the leukemia cell carrying it does not acquire a growth advantage and will not be selected. Although simple models should be inspected using various replication systems, we think the replication error is thus an underlying mechanism for FLT3/ITD. Finally, investigation of FLT3/ITD would provide a new perspective on leukemia as to genetic instability and aberrant signal transduction, as well as leukemia progression.  Somatic mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 consisting of internal tandem duplications (ITD) occur in 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. They are associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. In this study, we characterized the oncogenic potential and signaling properties of Flt3 mutations. We constructed chimeric molecules that consisted of the murine Flt3 backbone and a 510-base pair human Flt3 fragment, which contained either 4 different ITD mutants or the wild-type coding sequence. Flt3 isoforms containing ITD mutations (Flt3- ITD) induced factor-independent growth and resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in 32D cells. Cells containing Flt3- ITD, but not those containing wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), formed colonies in methylcellulose. Injection of 32D/Flt3-ITD induced rapid development of a leukemiatype disease in syngeneic mice. Flt3-ITD mutations exhibited constitutive autophosphorylation of the immature form of the Flt3 receptor. Analysis of the involved signal transduction pathways revealed that Flt3-ITD only slightly activated the MAP kinases Erk1 and 2 and the protein kinase B (Akt) in the absence of ligand and retained ligand-induced activation of these enzymes. However, Flt3-ITD led to strong factor-independent activation of STAT5. The relative importance of the STAT5 and Ras pathways for ITD-induced colony formation was assessed by transfection of dominant negative (dn) forms of these proteins: transfection of dnSTAT5 inhibited colony formation by 50%. Despite its weak constitutive activation by Flt3-ITD, dnRas also strongly inhibited Flt3-ITD\\u2013 mediated colony formation. Taken together, Flt3-ITD mutations induce factor-independent growth and leukemogenesis of 32D cells that are mediated by the Ras and STAT5pathways.(Blood.2000;96:3907-3914) \\u00a9 2000 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction The receptor tyrosine kinase Flt31-3 and its ligand FL4-6 play an important role in survival and self-renewal of early hematopoietic progenitors and monocytic precursors and in early lymphoid development.7-9 The expression of Flt3 on leukemic cell lines and samples from patients with acute leukemia has been extensively studied. Flt3 is expressed on most acute leukemias of myeloid and B-lymphoid origin.10,11 Incubation of leukemic blasts with FL results in enhanced DNA synthesis in some, but not all cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)10-15 and in a reduced rate of spontaneous apoptosis of AML blasts.16 Chronic overexpression of Flt3 ligand in hematopoietic progenitors has been shown to induce hematologic malignancies after a long latency period.17 Somatic mutations involving a set of in-frame internal tandem duplications (ITDs) occur at the end of exon 11 of the Flt3 gene. These result in the duplication of a stretch of several amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor.18 ITD mutations are detectable in about 20% of AML samples18 but not in normal hematopoiesis,19 and they are associated with high leukemic cell numbers in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.20 The presence of ITD mutations of Flt3 on AML blasts indicates a very poor prognosis.21-23 So far, little is known about the functional consequences of ITD mutations. Expression of ITD-containing Flt3 in COS-7 cells resulted in its constitutive autophosphorylation.20 Our own results indicated that constitutive autophosphorylation of Flt3 is detectable in about 10% of AML cases.24 However, autophosphorylation did not correlate with ITD mutations. The growth of AML blasts with ITD mutations in stroma cell cultures was inhibited compared with blasts not containing ITD mutations.25 In this study, we show that ITD mutations of Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) have oncogenic potential. ITD mutations confer factor-independent growth and radiation resistance onto 32D cells. Also, they induce colony growth in semisolid media, which is not supported by Flt3 ligand in 32D cells transfected with wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT). When injected into syngeneic hosts, Flt3-ITD, but not Flt3-WT, leads to the rapid development of a disease resembling leukemia. Analysis of the signaling properties of Flt3-ITD reveals weak constitutive activation of Ras and Akt with ligand-dependent augmentation and strong constitutive activation of STAT5, a novel feature of Flt3 signaling. STAT5 is not activated by a ligand-bound wild-type receptor. Analyses by dominant negative (dn) constructs show an important role of Ras and STAT5 for ITD-induced colony formation. Taken together, ITD mutations of Flt3 have powerful transforming potential in myeloid cells mediated by Ras and aberrant STAT5 activation.

For personal use only. Materials and methods Reagents Recombinant human FL and recombinant murine interleukin 3 (IL-3) were purchased from Pepro Tech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Polyclonal rabbit antimouse Flt3 antibodies and the antiphosphoSTAT5 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal rat antimouse Flt3 antibody was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal mouse antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). AntiphosphoErk2, anti-Erk2, and total anti-STAT5a/b antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. AntiphosphoAkt and anti-Akt were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-ras antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The Annexin-V FITC kit was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Cell lines The IL-3\\u2013dependent murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3 (kindly provided by Dr Felicitas Rosenthal, Freiburg, Germany) was cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and antibiotics at 37\\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Construction of expression plasmids and transfection into 32Dcl3 cells ITD mutations were detected in patients with AML as described previously.24 The membrane proximal region of 4 mutated Flt3 receptor sequences, as well as wild-type human Flt3 derived from the Oci-AML5 cell line, were amplified by reverse transcriptase\\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using Pfu DNA polymerase. The sense primer was 59-GCA CAT CTT GTG AGA CGA TCC-39 and the antisense primer was 59-CAC CAT AGC AAC AAT ATT CAA AAA TC-39, yielding a product corresponding to nucleotides 1562 to 2092 of the published sequence of human Flt3.3 One of 2 SspI sites of the PCR products, which is unique to the human Flt3 sequence, was removed by site-directed mutagenesis without alteration of the resulting amino acid code. A BsmBI/SspI fragment of these PCR products spanning nt1567 to 2077 was substitutionally introduced into the sequence of murine Flt3 (provided by Dr I. Lemischka, Princeton, NJ). The sequences of all mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These constructs were cloned into an expression vector (pAL) under the control of the 59LTR of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MoMSV), derived from pLXSN (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Ten micrograms of plasmid DNA of either plasmid and 1 mg pMAM/BSD (Kaken Pharmaceutical, Japan) were cotransfected into 32Dcl3 cells by electroporation. Cells were selected with 15 mg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) in IL-3 supplemented culture. Polyclonal cell lines were used for further experiments. The ovine STAT5/Y694F mutant (dnSTAT5)26 was subcloned into an expression vector under the control of the 59LTR of the MoMSV (pOPALI), derived from pOPI3CAT (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contained a neomycin resistance marker. Lac inducible system The 32Dcl3 were first transfected with pLAM-LacR, which was derived from pMAM and expresses the Lac repressor. The 32D/pLAM-LacR were further transfected with pOPRSVI (Stratagene) containing RasS17N (dnRas), the expression of which is suppressed by the Lac repressor in the uninduced state, and induced by the addition of isopropyl thiogalactose (IPTG). Highly inducible dnRas-expressing clones were selected by limiting dilution. One of the clones was cotransfected with the pAL/Flt3 constructs and pPur (Clontech) as a selection marker, and puromycin-selected polyclonal lines were used for further experiments. The expression of dnRas was induced by incubating the cell lines with 0.5 mmol/L IPTG for 24 hours, and the expression was verified by Western blotting with anti-ras Ab (Upstate Biotechnology). Flow cytometry Cells were preincubated for 15 minutes at 4\\u00b0C with mouse IgG and subsequently stained for 15 minutes with the indicated antibody. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis The 32Dcl3 cells transfected with Flt3 constructs were starved from IL-3 and serum for 12 hours in 0.5% FCS. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in 1 mL medium for 10 minutes at 37\\u00b0C with or without 100 ng/mL FL, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 50 mmol/L ZnCl, 25 mmol/L NaF, proteinase inhibitors (Complete; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mmol/L pepstatin, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were clarified at 20 000g for 20 minutes. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to murine Flt3 (Upstate Biotechnology) and with Protein A/G-Plus-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates as well as total lysates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, heated, and separated by SDS PAGE. Gels were blotted on Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stained with the indicated antibody. Antibody binding was detected by incubation with an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescence detection (ECL-Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). 3H thymidine incorporation A total of 1 3 104 32D cells was IL-3 and serum starved (0.5% FCS) for 12 hours. Subsequently, cells were placed in 200 mL medium supplemented with the indicated concentrations of FL. After a 24-hour incubation at 37\\u00b0C, 0.037 MBq (1 mCi) 3H thymidine was added to each well, and cells were incubated for an additional 8 hours. Cells were harvested on glass fiber filters, and b-emission of the bound DNA was analyzed with a scintillation counter. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Each data point represents the mean 6 standard deviation of 4 wells. Radiation-induced apoptosis A total of 2.5 3 105 cells was starved from IL-3 and serum for 3 hours, placed in 24-well plates, and exposed to 5 Gy g-irradiation. Immediately after irradiation, cells were supplemented with FL (100 ng/mL), IL-3 (1 ng/mL), or no factor. Cell viability was analyzed using the Annexin-V assay. Cells staining negative for both Annexin-V and propidium iodide were counted as viable cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay The 32D cells exposed to the indicated cytokines were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mmol/L PMSF and 0.2 mmol/L NaVO3 and lysed in 500 mL cold buffer I (20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2% [vol/vol] Nonidet P-40, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.2 mmol/L NaVO3, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, and 10 mg/mL aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 10 minutes, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 2\\u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in 100 mL buffer II, containing 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 420 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L NaVO3, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, and 10 mg/mL aprotinin, and incubated for 30 minutes at 4\\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 20 minutes at 2\\u00b0C, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer III (20 mmol/L HEPES [pH 7.9], 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L NaVO3, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF) for 4 hours at 4\\u00b0C. The DNA mobility shift assay was performed by incubating 10 mg nuclear extract with 1 mg poly(dI-dC) and 20 000 cpm of the end-labeled, double-stranded probe in binding buffer (10 mmol/L Tris [pH 7.5], 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 3908 MIZUKI et al BLOOD, 1 DECEMBER 2000 z VOLUME 96, NUMBER 12 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28, 2017.

The double-stranded oligonucleotide was 59-AGA TTT CTA GGA ATT CAA TCC-39, harboring the consensus binding site for STAT5.27 DNA-protein complexes were run on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel carried out in 0.5x Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to film. DNA supershift assays were performed by incubation of the nuclear proteins with a specific antibody directed against STAT5a/b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2 mg each per assay) for 15 minutes at 25\\u00b0C before the addition of the probe. Clonal growth in methylcellulose To analyze clonal growth, 1 mL of a culture mixture containing Iscove modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 1% methylcellulose, and 10% FCS was plated on a 35-mm culture dish in the presence of FL (20 to 200 ng/mL), IL-3 (1 ng/mL), or no cytokine. Stably transfected 32Dcl3 cells were seeded at a concentration of 3 3 102 or 3 3 103 cells per dish. The assays were plated as quadruplicates, and colonies were counted on day 6. The numbers given show representative results of one of at least 3 independent experiments per construct. To analyze the effect of the expression of dnSTAT5 on the colony growth, 32Dcl3/Flt3-ITD cells were electroporated with either 20 mg pOPALI/ STAT5Y694F or the same amount of pOPALI/CAT. One day after the electroporation, cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 3 105 cells per dish in 1 mL of a culture mix containing IMDM, 1% methylcellulose, 20% FCS, and 0.6 mg/dL G418. The colonies were counted on day 8. In vivo tumorigenesis assay Eight- to 10-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice, which were syngeneic with 32Dcl3 cells, were used for the in vivo tumorigenesis experiments. The 1 3 106 cells were inoculated by intravenous injection. Moribund animals were killed. Bone marrow cells were extracted from the femur and stained with Pappenheim stain. The experimental protocols had been reviewed and approved by the local Animal Experimentation Committee. Results Construction and expression of the chimeric mutant Flt3 receptors We have previously identified Flt3-ITD mutations from patients with AML.24 To examine the role of ITD mutations in leukemogenesis, we constructed mouse Flt3 complementary DNA (cDNA) mutants containing the mutated human Flt3 sequences (Figure 1A). Four different ITD mutations were cloned into the mouse backbone. These mutations were chosen because of their variable involvement of tyrosine residues and differences in the lengths of the duplication. The wild-type human Flt3 cDNA of this region was amplified from OCI-AML5. All constructs were introduced into the IL-3\\u2013dependent myeloid progenitor cell line 32D under the control of the MoMSV 59LTR. After selection of the bulk culture for 14 days in the presence of IL-3, stable expression of murine Flt3 was established as shown in Figure 1B. All Flt3-ITD mutant receptors were expressed at comparable levels with the wild-type human/ murine chimera Flt3 (Flt3-WT) or with wild-type murine Flt3 (data not shown). The parental or mock transfected 32D lines did not express Flt3 (Figure 1B). Factor-independent DNA synthesis of 32D/Flt3-ITD We analyzed the DNA-synthesis of the different mutants by 3H thymidine incorporation. The parental 32Dcl3 line did not respond to FL, whereas the Flt3-WT transfectant (32D/Flt3-WT) grew dependent on either IL-3 or FL. However, all cell lines containing Flt3-ITD (32D/Flt3-ITD) proliferated independently of exogenously added IL-3 or FL (Figure 2). In addition, FL did not further increase the rate of DNA synthesis in 32D/Flt3-ITD. Thymidine incorporation of 32D/Flt3-ITD was much higher compared with Flt3-WT cells stimulated with maximal levels of FL. As shown in Figure 2A, DNA synthesis of ITD-containing 32D cells without exogenously added growth factors approximately equaled their synthesis rate under the influence of maximal IL-3 stimulation (10 ng/mL). Resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis of 32D/Flt3-ITD It had been reported that FL mediates survival of early hematopoietic precursors as well as AML cells.16,28 Therefore, we examined the role of ITD mutants in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3, 32D/Flt3-WT were highly sensitive to g-irradiation, with less than 10% viable cells 24 hours after irradiation. On FL exposure, up to 60% of 32D/Flt3-WT were rescued from apoptosis. Interestingly, cells transfected with Flt3-ITD were entirely resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis. The resistance was independent of FL presence or absence. Clonal growth of 32D/Flt3-ITD in methylcellulose To further analyze the effect of Flt3-ITD mutants on proliferation and survival, we examined the ability of 32D/Flt3-ITD cells to form colonies. The 32D cells transfected with the empty vector produced colonies in the presence of IL-3, but not in the presence of FL (Figure 4). Surprisingly, Flt3-WT could not support clonal growth of the 32D cells even in the presence of up to 200 ng/mL FL (Figure 4A). To confirm these findings, we repeated the experiment with 10 times the number of cells per dish. In addition, appropriate expression of Flt3 on the surface of the cells was checked Figure 1.

For personal use only. immediately before plating. We still did not detect any colonies, evidencing that Flt3-WT did not allow clonal growth of 32D cells in methylcellulose (Figure 4B). Results obtained with wild-type mouse Flt3 were identical (data not shown). In stark contrast, Flt3-ITD led to colony formation of 32D cells, even in the absence of IL-3 and FL (Figure 4). Taken together, these results indicate that signaling of Flt3-ITD may elicit a signal quality different from the wild-type isoforms of Flt3. Flt3-ITD induce leukemogenesis of 32D cells in vivo Previously, we have shown that a mutation in the catalytic domain of Flt3 leads to factor-independent receptor autophosphorylation, proliferation, and survival of 32D cells.24 However, when we injected cells carrying these mutations into syngeneic mice, they developed obvious disease very late, with a latency period of several months (M.M., R.S., H.S., unpublished data). Therefore, we investigated whether Flt3-ITD mutants enhance leukemogenesis of 32D cells in vivo. The 32D/Flt3-ITD1, 32D/Flt3-ITD2, 32D/Flt3-WT, and 32D/mock cells were intravenously injected into syngeneic mice. In all but one of the mice injected with 32D/Flt3-ITD1 or 32D/Flt3-ITD2, a disease resembling leukemia developed, with massive enlargement of spleen and liver and infiltration of the bone marrow by blastlike cells (Figure 5). Most animals injected with these cells died within 5 weeks after injection (Figure 6). Mice injected with 32D/mock or 32D/Flt3-WT did not develop obvious disease up to 3 months after injection. After this time, 2 of 10 animals injected with 32D/Flt3-WT developed a similar disease, as did the animals injected with the ITD-containing cells, and died. Constitutive activation of the Flt3 receptor and ligand-dependent activation of MAPK and Akt in 32D/Flt3-ITD To analyze the signaling properties of Flt3-ITD in comparison to Flt3-WT, we first studied the autophosphorylation status of the Flt3 mutants in transfected 32D cells. The cells were IL-3 and serum starved for 12 hours and FL stimulated in the absence of serum for 10 minutes. From the cell lysates, Flt3 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with an antiphosphotyrosine moAb or an anti-Flt3 polyclonal antibody. Interestingly, we detected aberrant and constitutive autophosphorylation of the lower band of the mutant Flt3 isoforms, which corresponds to its immature, possibly intracellular form (Figure 7).29 In contrast, the mature form seems to retain its ligand-specific autophosphorylation pattern, at least in some cases. Also, the balance between the immature and the mature forms of the receptor was disturbed, because only weak expression of the mature form of the receptor was seen on Flt3 immunoblots. To examine downstream signals, total cell lysates of all 4 ITD mutant cell lines were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies specific to the activation status of signal transduction molecules. The loading conditions of the gels were verified by antibodies detecting the molecules independent of their activation state. To detect MAPK activation, we used an anti-pErk antibody, which is specific for Erk1/2 phosphorylated on tyrosine 204. To detect the activation of PI3K-dependent pathways, we analyzed the activation of Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase downstream of PI3K, which has been implicated in cell survival. The anti-pAkt\\u2013specific antibody detects Akt, which is phosphorylated at serine 473. As shown in Figure 7, Erk1/2 and Akt were activated ligand dependently in 32D/Flt3-ITD cells, with slightly increased basal levels of Figure 3. Ligand-independent resistance against radiation-induced apoptosis. Cells were starved for 3 hours and exposed to 5 Gy g-irradiation. Cells that were Annexin-V and propidium iodide-negative were counted as viable cells. Viability was calculated as a percentage of these cells over the total cell population. FL concentration was 100 ng/mL. Figure 2. Ligand-independent 3H thymidine incorporation by Flt3-ITD mutants. Cells were starved for 12 hours from IL-3 and serum and stimulated with FL (100 ng/mL or indicated concentrations), IL-3 (10 ng/mL), or no cytokine. Data are shown as percentage of thymidine incorporation compared with thymidine incorporation of the respective cell line under IL-3 stimulation. Note the different scale of the y-axis in the 2 diagrams of B. 3910 MIZUKI et al BLOOD, 1 DECEMBER 2000 z VOLUME 96, NUMBER 12 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28, 2017. For personal use only. phosphorylation. Only one ITD construct, ITD2, led to significant constitutive activation of the Erk proteins. Taken together, the ITD mutations induced factor-independent autophosphorylation of the immature form of Flt3. In the absence of ligand, they did not induce strong activation of Erk proteins or of Akt. Constitutive activation of STAT5 in 32D/Flt3-ITD To analyze STAT5 activation, we first used an antibody specific for STAT5a/b phosphorylated on tyrosine 694. Flt3-WT induced very weak phosphorylation of STAT5 after FL stimulation (Figure 8A) However, the ITD mutants induced strong constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5. To confirm the activation of STAT5 in a different assay system, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a STAT5-specific probe (Figure 8B). On stimulation with IL-3, both WT and ITD mutants showed similar DNA binding activity of STAT5. Only 32D/Flt3-ITD cells showed constitutive DNA binding activity, and even FL stimulation could not induce STAT5 DNA binding in 32D/Flt3-WT. The DNA binding activity of 32D/Flt3-ITD was confirmed to be STAT5 by supershift analyses with an anti-STAT5 antibody. Effects of dominant negative Ras and STAT5 on ITD-induced colony formation To examine the consequences of STAT5 activation in 32D/Flt3- ITD, we analyzed the effects of dnSTAT5 on the colony formation of 32D/Flt3-ITD. After transfection of STAT5Y694F (dnSTAT5), the colony formation of 32D/Flt3-ITD1 was reduced by approximately 50%, compared with the transfection of a control vector (Figure 9A). As shown in Figure 7, we observed weak MAPK activation by some of the ITD mutations in the absence of exogenously added Flt3 ligand. Also, inactivation of STAT5 did not abrogate the Flt3-ITD\\u2013induced colony growth completely. Therefore, we were interested in examining the relative role of the Ras/MAPK pathway for the function of the ITD mutations. We used the Lac-inducible system, in which the expression of dnRas (Ras S17N) was repressed by the Lac repressor. Repression was relieved by IPTG, leading to highly inducible expression of the dominant negative construct, as shown in Figure 9B. The colony formation induced by the ITD forms of Flt3 was strongly inhibited by dnRas induction, as shown in Figure 9B for ITD1. Similar results were obtained with ITD2 (data not shown), which had caused considerable constitutive activation of MAPK in the pErk blot (Figure 7). IPTG alone did not show any effect on cell lines transfected with the empty control vector. Figure 4. Clonal growth of 32D cells in methylcellulose.

All but one mouse injected with ITD1 or ITD2 developed the disease (described in the text and in Figure 5) within 4 to 5 weeks after injection and died. Mice injected with wild-type Flt3 survived without obvious disease until day 77 and day 92, when 2 of 10 mice developed the identical disease and also died.

Discussion In this report, we demonstrate that internal tandem repeat mutations of Flt3, which are readily detectable in about 20% of cases with AML18,30 and which indicate a poor prognosis of the disease,21-23 elicit transforming ability in the factor-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32D. Our analyses of the autophosphorylation pattern of the Flt3 mutations indicate that ITD mutations cause constitutive autophosphorylation of Flt3. We also demonstrate that the observed activation of Flt3 is sufficient to mediate proliferation and survival in the absence of ligand, even if the mature form of the receptor is only marginally autophosphorylated. Furthermore, the mutant receptors alter cellular behavior in a way not seen with ligandactivated wild-type Flt3. The mechanism of Flt3 activation by mutation in the juxtamembrane domain remains elusive. Constitutive activation of the close relative Kit by point mutations and small deletions in the juxtamembrane region has been studied extensively,31,32 showing that ligandindependent dimerization occurs in the cellular membrane. Mutations in the kinase domain of Kit cause intracellular dimerization and activation of the receptor.33 Recently, it has been reported that in the Kit juxtamembrane domain, methionine 552 to isoleucine 563 form a putative alpha-helical conformation, and that substitution of any of 4 different amino acids sitting along the hydrophobic side of the alpha-helix leads to receptor activation.34 We also were interested in juxtamembrane deletion mutants of Flt3 and constructed a deletion mutant, in which all 4 potential tyrosine autophosphorylation sites were eliminated. This mutant also showed ligand-independent receptor autophosphorylation, proliferation, and apoptosis resistance, suggesting that the conformational change of the juxtamembrane domain, due to either addition or deletion, leads to receptor activation and similar biologic effects (M.M., R.F., H.S., manuscript in preparation). Taken together, ITD mutations in the Flt3 juxtamembrane region seem to disturb the Figure 7. Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt3 and ligand-dependent activation of MAP kinase and Akt. After a 12-hour starvation period, 1 3 107 cells were stimulated for 10 minutes in 1 mL medium with or without 100 ng/mL FL for 10 minutes as indicated. Immunoprecipitates with anti-Flt3 were performed where indicated, and the immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. After blotting, the blots were stained with the indicated activation-specific antibodies. pErk recognizes Erk1 (p44), and Erk2 (p42), phosphorylated on tyrosine 204; pAkt is specific for Akt phosphorylated on serine 473. Subsequently, the blots were stripped and stained with the indicated protein-specific antibodies to demonstrate equal loading: tErk is specific for total Erk2 (p42) and does not recognize Erk1. Figure 8. Constitutive activation of STAT5 by Flt3-ITD. (A) Detection of STAT5 activation by immunoblot. Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-pSTAT5, which reacts with STAT5 phosphorylated on tyrosine 694, or antitotal STAT5 as indicated. (B) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of STAT5. Nuclear extracts were incubated with a double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus STAT5 binding sequence. Results from 2 constructs are shown: ITD1 (lanes 1-5) and Flt3-WT (lanes 6-10). The stimulation conditions of the cells before lysis are indicated: no growth factors added (N, lanes 1 and 6), 10 ng/mL IL-3 for 10 minutes (IL-3, lanes 2, 3 and 7, 8), and 100 ng/mL FL (FL, lanes 4, 5 and 9, 10). To verify the presence of STAT5 in the shifted oligonucleotide/ protein complex, a supershift assay was performed with an anti-STAT5a/b antibody as indicated (lanes 3, 5 and 8, 10). Note that no shift or supershift is visible in unstimulated and FL-stimulated wild-type Flt3 cells, whereas shifted complexes containing STAT5 can be seen in ITD1 cells. Figure 9. Effects of dominant negative constructs on colony formation induced by Flt3-ITD. (A) Equal amounts of an empty control vector and a dominant negative STAT5 (Y694F) were electroporated into 32D cells containing ITD1. One day after electroporation, cells were plated at a concentration of 1 3 105 cells per dish in the presence of 0.6 mg/mL G418 and no cytokine. Numbers of colonies were counted at day 8. Data shown are representative of 3 independent experiments. (B) Inducible expression of dn-Ras.

These cells were subjected to a colony assay as described in Figure 4, under the presence or absence of IPTG. 3912 MIZUKI et al BLOOD, 1 DECEMBER 2000 z VOLUME 96, NUMBER 12 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 28, 2017. For personal use only. conformation of a tertiary structure, which normally exerts inhibitory control over unoccupied receptor tyrosine kinases. The ITD mutations significantly shorten the latency period, which is required for Flt3 to transform 32D cells into a fully oncogenic cell line in vivo. The low, but detectable transforming ability of induced wild-type Flt3 expression is in accordance with the ability of c-kit to induce leukemogenesis in 32D cells, with a long latency period.35 The additional effect of the ITD mutations most likely depends on the ligand-independent activation of Flt3. We found that all types of Flt3-ITD do not only confer constitutive activation of the major biologic functions of Flt3, but also induce additional functions in 32D cells. Of particular interest is the ability of ITD mutations to support clonal growth. The surprising difference between activated wild-type Flt3 and the ITD mutations could be attributable to a complementary signal necessary for the Flt3 response in semisolid media, but not in suspension culture. The ITD mutations obviously bypass the necessity for this. They seem to provide an intracellular signal different from activated wild-type receptors. We analyzed intermediates of several signaling pathways and could indeed find qualitative differences in the signals provided by wild-type and ITD receptors. Our results show that Flt3 activatesAkt, which has been shown to be an enzyme regulated by phosphoinositide products of PI3 kinase. The importance of PI3 kinase signaling for Flt3-mediated proliferation and survival is controversial, because the binding of the enzyme to Flt3 has not been demonstrated with certainty. On the other hand, it has been recently shown that Flt3 activates PI3 kinase by alternative mechanisms.36,37 Thus, our results showing the activation of Akt by wild-type Flt3 are in line with the latter experiments. We and others have shown that the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathways are involved in proliferation and survival induced by ligand-activated wild-type Flt3.38-40 Although the ITD mutants induced autonomous proliferation and survival of 32D cells, constitutive activation of MAP kinase and Akt was only weak in most of the ITD-containing cell lines. In contrast, STAT5 is strongly and constitutively activated by all ITD mutations tested, whereas STAT5 phosphorylation by wildtype Flt3 is very weak and does not translate into its enhanced DNA binding after Flt3 stimulation. After the initial submission of this paper, the constitutive activation of STAT5 by ITD mutations and the lack of STAT5 activation by wild-type Flt3 has been independently described by others,41 confirming our results of differential signaling between wild-type and ITD-mutated Flt3. Our results provide the first evidence for the relative importance of the different signaling pathways for Flt3/ITD function: both Ras and STAT5 are important for Flt3/ITD-induced colony formation of 32D cells. Transfection of dominant negative STAT5 does not inhibit colony growth completely. One explanation could be that other signaling pathways, possibly other STAT proteins, can substitute for STAT5. The relative importance of Ras-dependent signaling pathways is unexpected, given the low constitutive activation of MAPK by the Flt3 mutations. On the other hand, wild-type Flt3 strongly activates the Ras/MAPK pathway, but does not induce colony formation (Figures 4 and 7). Obviously, basic activity of the Ras/MAPK pathway is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for 32D cells to grow in colonies. In recent reports, it was shown that STAT proteins are coactivated by Ras-dependent signals: expression of dominant negative Ras in a T-cell line inhibited IL-2\\u2013induced STAT5 activity on a b-casein promotor.42 Also, full STAT3 activation has been shown to be dependent on Rac, which is downstream of Ras.43 Thus, by inhibiting Ras function, we inhibit the activation of STAT5 and other STAT proteins of potential importance for Flt3/ITD-induced colony formation, a possible explanation for its relative importance for transformation of 32D cells. Taken together, our results show that the ITD mutations activate signaling pathways differently from wild-type Flt3, which results in a different phenotype of 32D cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we provide evidence that frequently occurring Flt3 mutations from patients with AML are leukemogenic in 32D cells. The leukemogenic effect is based on several intracellular signals of these receptor mutants, which involve the basal Ras activation and the constitutive activation of STAT5. Future work will have to elucidate these signaling pathways in still more detail. This will hopefully result in a more sophisticated picture of how proliferation and survival of leukemic blasts are regulated and how they may be subjected to specific therapeutic interventions.  Internal tandem duplications of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are one of the most frequent gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor clinical outcome. The remission rate is high with intensive chemotherapy, but most patients eventually relapse. During the last decade, FLT3 mutations have emerged as an attractive target for a molecularly specific treatment strategy. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinases in AML has shown encouraging results in the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML, but in most patients responses are incomplete and not sustained. Newer, more specific compounds seem to have a higher potency and selectivity against FLT3. During therapy with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) the induction of acquired resistance has emerged as a clinical problem. Therefore, optimization of the targeted therapy and potential treatment options to overcome resistance is currently the focus of clinical research. In this review we discuss the use and limitations of TKIs as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML, including mechanisms of resistance to TKIs as well as possible novel strategies to improve FLT3 inhibitor therapy.  Keywords: Acute myeloid leukemia, FLT3 mutations, molecular tailored therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mechanism of resistance Go to: Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant clonal disorder of the hematopoietic system characterized by an enormous heterogeneity of acquired genetic and epigenetic changes in hematopoietic precursor cells and by impaired mechanisms of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. To date, more than 200 structural and numerical cytogenetic abnormalities have been described in this disease, with incidences ranging from <0.1% to 10% [1]. More recently, a variety of gene mutations, deregulated expression of genes, and non-coding RNAs (microRNAs) and epigenetic changes have also been identified in AML over the past few years [2,3].  In a model of the pathogenesis of AML proposed a decade ago, it was postulated that there are at least two classes of mutations that are necessary for the development of AML, with one class affecting the growth factor pathways and the other class resulting in a block in differentiation [4]. More recently, with the advent of whole genome sequencing of AML specimens, a variation on this two-step model has been suggested, in which an initiating driver mutation, such as NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH2 or TET2 , confers a survival advantage to a hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell. This is followed by a cooperating driver mutation, which results in full-blown transformation to AML [5]. This model will undoubtedly evolve, in light of the evidence that AML is polyclonal at presentation, but changes its clonality and mutational profile over time in the setting of chemotherapy and eventual relapse [6]. The most common cooperating mutation in both models is an internal tandem duplication mutation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3-ITD mutation). FLT3-ITD mutations constitutively activate the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and its downstream signaling pathways, leading to dysregulation of cellular proliferation [7\\u20139].  Since RTK mutations play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AML and are relatively common, they seem to be an ideal target for a molecularly tailored treatment approach. Targeting FLT3 RTK signaling in particular is very attractive given that FLT3 mutations are found in approximately one-third of patients with AML [10].  In this article, we discuss the use and limitations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML. Mechanisms of resistance to TKIs are highlighted as well as possible novel strategies to improve FLT3 inhibitor therapy.  Go to: FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia FLT3, located on chromosome 13q12, is grouped into the class III RTK family, and was first described by Nakao et al. in 1996 [11]. The FLT3 gene plays an important role in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [10]. FLT3 mutations are found in about one-third of all patients with AML, and are one of the most frequent genetic abnormalities found in AML [2]. At present, three different activating FLT3 gene mutations are known: FLT3-ITD mutations, which can be detected in approximately 20% [11\\u201313], point mutations in the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3 -TKD), detectable in about 6\\u20138% [14,15], and point mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) as well as extracellular domain of the receptor, which are very rare (approximately 2%) [16]. The most common mutation, FLT3-ITD, leads to a ligand-independent dimerization and constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domain, thus prompting factor-independent cell growth [7]. These mutations are associated with constitutive activation of multiple downstream pathways, such as phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (PIK3/AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) [8,9]. Previously, it was thought that FLT3-ITD mutations insert exclusively within the JM domain. Recently, however, we and others have shown that about one-third of FLT3-ITD mutations insert outside the JM domain, in particular in the \\u03b21-sheet of the tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TKD1; Figure 1) [17\\u2013 19]. In cell culture analyses, a prototypic FLT3-ITD with insertion site in the \\u03b22-sheet of the TKD1 ( FLT3-ITD627E) mediated phosphorylation of FLT3 and STAT5, suggesting that non-JM domain FLT3-ITD mutations confer constitutive activation of the receptor [18]. Additionally, FLT3-ITD627E induced transformation of hematopoietic 32D cells and led to a lethal myeloproliferative disease in a syngeneic mouse model [18]. A dramatic up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) protein expression could be shown after expression of the FLT3-ITD627E receptor in a cell culture model [20]. Increased binding capacity of the adaptor protein Grb2 to the FLT3-receptor was shown to be involved in MCL-1 up-regulation and was independent from TKI (midostaurin)-induced inhibition of the receptor kinase [20].  Figure 1 Figure 1 Schematic structure of the FLT3 receptor displaying the frequency of FLT3-ITD insertion sites in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain as well as in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain 1 (according to [17]). Besides the insertion site, FLT3-ITD mutations show a broad variability in the mutant to wild-type (WT) allelic ratio, in the size of the insertion (ranging from three to over 100 base pairs), and the number of affected clones per patient [12, 17, 19, 21\\u201328].  Patients with AML harboring FLT3-ITD mutations have characteristic pretreatment features including increased white blood cell count, a higher percentage of blood and bone marrow blasts, and a more frequent diagnosis of de novo rather than secondary AML [13, 21]. FLT3-ITD mutations are most frequently associated with a normal karyotype as well as with the translocations t(6;9)(p23;q34) [29] and t(15;17)(q22;q12) [30]. In cytogenetically normal AML, FLT3-ITD mutations confer a worse prognosis due to a high relapse rate and adverse overall survival (OS) [13, 21, 22, 27]. Furthermore, previous studies suggested a prognostic role for the mutant to WT allelic ratio, as quantified by Gene-Scan analysis, and the size of the ITD [21\\u201327]. So far, data on the allelic ratio consistently show an association of high allelic burden with worse prognosis, whereas the prognosis of patients with a low FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (allelic ratio either < 0.5 or < 0.78) is discussed controversially [21, 22, 27]. The data published by Gale et al . are in contrast to another study, where no significant difference in outcome was found between lower level mutants and WT FLT3 , although the exact cut-offs for the allelic ratio varied [21,27]. One possible explanation for this finding could be that in these patients the FLT3-ITD mutation occurred in a late stage of leukemogenesis, including a lower addiction to FLT3-ITD signaling. And even the responsiveness to FLT3 TKIs seems to depend on the FLT3 allelic ratio [31]. Patients at diagnosis seem to present more often with lower allelic ratios, which are relatively less addicted to FLT3-ITD signaling for survival as compared to those at the time point of relapse [31]. In an in vitro analysis, relapsed samples and samples with a high mutant allelic ratio were more likely to be responsive to cytotoxicity from FLT3 TKIs as compared to the samples obtained at diagnosis or those with a low mutant allelic ratio [31]. However, the results probably indicate that the presence of a FLT3-ITD with even a low allelic ratio cannot be excluded altogether from prognostic risk stratification. For instance, if the presence of a FLT3-ITD provides resistance to chemotherapy by enhancing DNA repair and salvage of damaged cells [32], then mutant-carrying cells will have a survival advantage on treatment with conventional chemotherapy, irrespective of their relative proportion in the total population.  Besides the allelic ratio, the prognostic impact of the FLT3-ITD size is also a matter of debate. Both longer and shorter FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with an inferior outcome, or have been shown to have no prognostic impact [23\\u2013 27]. Moreover, we were able to show that a FLT3-ITD insertion site in the \\u03b21-sheet of the TKD1 was associated with an inferior outcome as compared to all other insertion sites for younger adult patients with AML who had been treated with intensive chemotherapy, even after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant [17, 33]. Recently, these results have been confirmed by Schnittger and colleagues, who could show that FLT3-ITD insertion sites localized more C-terminally within the FLT3 gene were associated with an adverse outcome [19].  Furthermore, the molecular background of cooperating mutations, such as NPM1 and DNMT3A , may influence the prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD positive AML. Yet again, the prognostic impact of a concurrent NPM1 mutation in FLT3-ITD positive AML is discussed controversially. In a publication by Gale and co-workers, a better outcome in FLT3-ITD positive patients harboring a concurrent NPM1 mutation was stated [27], whereas according to other authors the \\u201cprotective effect\\u201c of NPM1 in AML with a higher FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (\\u2265 0.5) seemed at least to be diminished or to get lost [34]. Recently published data suggest that FLT3-ITD retains its negative prognostic impact in intermediate-risk AML, even in the context of other genetic abnormalities, such as DNMT3A and TET2 [35].  For FLT3 -TKD mutations, point mutations, small insertions or deletions can be found in exon 20 of the FLT3 gene, most commonly a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine at codon 835, which affect the activation loop of the carboxy terminal part of the TKD [2]. FLT3 -TKD mutations stabilize the activation loop of the open adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP)-binding configuration, thus leading to constitutive activation of the FLT3 gene. When transduced into murine hematopoietic stem cells, FLT3 -TKD mutations induce an oligoclonal lymphoid disorder, suggesting differences in cell signaling between FLT3 -TKD mutants and FLT3-ITDs [36]. Indeed, strong STAT5 activation could only be demonstrated for FLT3-ITD mutations [36,37]. Currently, the prognostic value of a FLT3 -TKD mutation is still unclear [2,38,39].  Go to: Treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors Activation of signaling pathways via RTKs plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AML, and inhibition of these tyrosine kinases using small molecules represents an attractive therapeutic concept. One option to interfere with FLT3 activity is to inhibit its kinase activity. TKIs compete with ATP for binding to the active pocket of the kinases, resulting in the inability to autophosphorylate or phosphorylate substrate proteins by transferring the terminal phosphate of ATP. Thus, signal transduction initiated by the mutated RTK is interrupted [40]. Several small molecule kinase inhibitors with activity against FLT3 have been evaluated in patients with AML as single agents and in combination with intensive chemotherapy, e.g. midostaurin (PKC412), lestaurtinib (CEP-701), tandutinib (MLN-518), sunitinib (SU11248) and sorafenib (BAY 43\\u20139006) [41]. These compounds were not specifically developed as FLT3 inhibitors, but exhibit activity against other RTKs, as summarized in Table I. In single-agent phase I and II trials in relapsed or refractory AML, responses were generally limited and not durable. Clinical experience using FLT3 TKIs is outlined below and summarized in Table II.  Table I Table I Overview of preclinical characteristics of FLT3-tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in clinical trials. Table II Table II Overview on reported data from clinical trials investigating the efficacy of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Midostaurin  In a phase II trial, midostaurin has been evaluated as single-agent therapy in 20 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML, including one patient with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), at a dose of 75 mg orally three times daily [42]. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) showed a decrease of peripheral blast counts by 50%, and seven of the 20 patients (35%) experienced a greater than 2-log reduction in peripheral blast counts for at least 4 weeks (median response duration, 13 weeks; range, 9 \\u2013 47 weeks). In six of the 20 patients (30%) bone marrow blast counts were reduced by 50%, and two of these achieved a complete clearance of bone marrow blasts [42]. In combination with chemotherapy, midostaurin induced high complete remission (CR) rates in FLT3 mutated AML [43], and based on these favorable results the impact of midostaurin in AML with FLT3-ITD was evaluated in a large international randomized phase III study (Table III). This trial reached its accrual goal of over 700 patients with FLT3 mutated AML in October 2011, and first results are expected in 2014. An important issue relates to the scheduling and duration of treatment with the TKI. Administration of midostaurin simultaneously with chemotherapy appeared to be more toxic than a sequential approach, where midostaurin was given after chemotherapy [43]. Therefore, in the completed randomized phase III trial, midostaurin was administered sequentially following chemotherapy. Currently, the German - Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) is evaluating the impact of midostaurin given in combination with intensive induction, consolidation including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and single-agent maintenance therapy on event-free survival in a single-arm, multicenter phase II study in adult patients with AML with FLT3-ITD (Table III).  Table III Table III Overview of currently ongoing clinical trials evaluating FLT3-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in acute myeloid leukemia. Lestaurtinib  The TKI lestaurtinib has been evaluated as a single-agent therapy in a phase I \\u2013 II trial in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3 mutated AML [44]. Fourteen patients with AML were treated with lestaurtinib at an initial dose of 60 mg orally twice daily. Of those, five patients (36%) had clinical evidence of biologic activity and measurable clinical response, including significant reductions of myeloid blast cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. However, responses were generally short, lasting from 2 weeks to 3 months. In a follow-up phase II study, lestaurtinib was administered as first-line single-agent treatment for older patients with AML not considered fit for intensive chemotherapy, irrespective of FLT3 mutation status. Lestaurtinib was given orally for 8 weeks, initially at a dose of 60 mg twice daily, escalating to 80 mg twice daily, and was generally well tolerated. Clinical activity, manifest as transient reductions of myeloid blast cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow or longer periods of transfusion independence, was seen in three of five FLT3 mutated patients (60%) and five of 22 evaluable FLT3 WT patients (23%) [45]. In a randomized trial of FLT3 mutated AML in first relapse, 224 patients received chemotherapy alone or followed by 80 mg of lestaurtinib twice daily. Twenty-nine patients in the lestaurtinib arm achieved less than 5% myeloid blast cells in bone marrow as compared to 23 patients in the control arm (26% vs. 21%; p = 0.35). In this study, lestaurtinib treatment after chemotherapy did not increase response rates or prolong survival. Correlative studies from this trial, however, indicated that only a limited number of patients achieved FLT3 target inhibition with lestaurtinib [46]. Similar to midostaurin, the scheduling of lestaurtinib administration seems to be important, since lestaurtinib induced cytotoxicity only if it was used simultaneously or immediately following exposure to chemotherapy. This effect appeared to be attributable to the cell cycle arrest induced by lestaurtinib [47].  Sunitinib  Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of the multi-targeted oral TKI sunitinib have been evaluated in a single-dose phase I study in 29 patients with AML. The dose of sunitinib was escalated from 50 to 350 mg, in increments of 50 mg and cohorts of three to six patients. In this clinical trial, only five of the 29 (17%) patients harbored a FLT3 mutation: three patients had a FLT3-ITD and two patients a FLT3 -TKD. Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was dependent on dose and plasma drug levels. The primary end point, strong inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in > 50% patients, was reached in 200 mg and higher dose cohorts [48]. Furthermore, 15 patients with refractory AML were treated in a phase I study with sunitinib. Contrary to the encouraging results of midostaurin or sorafenib, single-agent therapy with sunitinib induced only partial responses (PRs) of short duration (4 \\u2013 16 weeks) in this cohort of patients with AML [49]. However, much better results have been reported recently on a phase I/II clinical study, which evaluated the feasibility of standard induction and consolidation therapy in combination with orally administered sunitinib in elderly patients with AML with activating FLT3 mutations. Median age in this trial was 70 years (range, 60 \\u2013 78 years). Interestingly, the CR rate in AML with FLT3-ITD was 53% (8/15) and was 71% (5/7) in those with FLT3 -TKD. All 13 patients who achieved a CR received repetitive cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy, and seven proceeded to single-agent sunitinib maintenance therapy (median duration, 11 months; range, 1 \\u2013 24 months). Within this study, median survival was 18.8 months, median relapse-free survival 11 months, and two patients are in sustained CR [50].  Sorafenib  The anti-leukemic activity of sorafenib was investigated in a phase I study in 16 patients with refractory or relapsed AML. Sorafenib was administered orally with dose levels from 200 to 400 mg twice daily. In this study, no dose limiting toxicity was observed. Sorafenib significantly reduced the percentage of myeloid blast cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow in patients with FLT3-ITD AML (n = 6/6), but showed only modest activity in FLT3 WT patients (n = 3/7) and no clinical response in patients with a FLT3 -TKD mutation (n = 0/3) [51]. A recently published study on 65 patients with FLT3-ITD AML treated with sorafenib monotherapy either after chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT further highlights these encouraging results [52]. In a pharmacodynamic phase I dose escalation study, evaluating sorafenib in 15 patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia, of whom only two harbored a FLT3-ITD mutation, no significant clinical responses were noted [53]. Sorafenib was further evaluated in combination with intensive chemotherapy in a combined phase I/II study [54]. In this study, sorafenib induced high CR rates in younger FLT3 mutated as well as FLT3 WT patients with AML. The survival rate at 1 year was 74% (median follow-up of 54 weeks; range, 8 \\u2013 87 weeks). Accompanying plasma inhibitory assays in 10 patients demonstrated an on-target effect on FLT3 kinase activity due to complete inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3 [54]. So far, there are only limited results for sorafenib treatment in older patients with AML (> 60 years). A completed randomized double-blinded study of 197 older patients with AML could not show a beneficial effect of sorafenib in combination with standard chemotherapy on clinical outcome [55]. In this study, however, there might have been biases, since the study was not selected for the target population and the proportion of FLT3-ITD was very low in the study cohort (28 of 197 patients; 14%). In the context of allogeneic HSCT, sorafenib has shown clinical activity in some cases of FLT3-ITD positive AML [52,56,57]. A case report of a patient with FLT3 -ITD positive AML after allogeneic HSCT illustrates that sorafenib in conjunction with graft-versus-leukemia effects could induce molecular negativity of FLT3-ITD after a second relapse [56]. Encouraging results had also been reported on the monotherapy with sorafenib in 65 patients with FLT3-ITD AML, who had been relapsed or were refractory after chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT [52]. Within this study, a response could be achieved in 83% of the patients (n = 54/65), including the achievement of a CR (with or without normalization of peripheral blood counts; n = 15). Furthermore, patients after prior allogeneic HSCT had a significantly lower rate of resistance toward sorafenib treatment as compared to those patients after chemotherapy (38% vs. 47%), as well as a longer remission duration (median, 197 days vs. 136 days; p = 0.03), suggesting that sorafenib therapy in the context of allogeneic HSCT may synergize with allogeneic immune effects [52]. However, these encouraging results could not be obtained in 16 patients with FLT3-ITD AML treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, who were relapsed after allogeneic HSCT [58]. The patients received either sorafenib alone (n = 8) or in combination with chemotherapy (n = 8). Although the number of circulating blasts decreased in 80% of cases, only three patients achieved a partial remission. Two patients were bridged to a second allogeneic HSCT, but both relapsed within 3 months and the median OS was only 83 days [58]. Currently, several studies evaluating the feasibility as well as efficacy of sorafenib maintenance after allogeneic HSCT are under way (Table III).  Quizartinib  While the first-generation TKIs showed only limited activity as a single agent, the second-generation TKI quizartinib (AC220) was effective as monotherapy in early phase I and II studies of patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Initially, quizartinib was identified due to screening of a scaffold-based library of compounds against several kinases [59]. Based on binding affinity, quizartinib was identified as a compound with high potency and selectivity for FLT3 [60]. In a phase I study, quizartinib was administered once daily as an oral solution in an outpatient setting for 14 days every 28 days at a starting dose of 12 mg, with dose escalations of 50% in subsequent cohorts. A later amendment included the ability to administer quizartinib continuously for 28 days without interruption. Observed adverse side effects were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms as well as prolongation of the QTc interval. The phase I study included 76 patients, of whom 18 (24%) were FLT3-ITD positive, 45 (59%) were FLT3 WT and 13 (17%) were indeterminate. Ten of 18 (56%) FLT3-ITD patients as compared to nine of 45 (20%) FLT3 WT patients responded. The median duration of response was 14 weeks. Of note, responses were observed in cohorts treated with doses as low as 18 and 40 mg/day. The FLT3 WT group comprised three patients with a FLT3 -TKD mutation, none of whom responded [60]. Very recently, the phase II study of quizartinib has reached its accrual goal of approximately 300 patients with AML. The trial consisted of two treatment cohorts: the first one comprised older patients (\\u2265 60 years) who had relapsed after one first-line chemotherapy regimen within 1 year or were primary refractory to first-line chemotherapy. The second cohort consisted of patients who were \\u2265 18 years of age and had relapsed or were refractory after one second-line (salvage) regimen or HSCT. Most patients in this study were FLT3-ITD positive, but a small number in each cohort lacked the mutation. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the composite CR rate, defined as the combination of CR, CR with incomplete platelet recovery and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery. Within both treatment cohorts, quizartinib as a single agent has shown promising efficacy, leading to a composite CR rate (CRc) of 46 \\u2013 54% in relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD positive AML [61,62]. Notably, remission rates were highest in patients who had relapsed after allogeneic HSCT, and a high percentage (37%) of cohort II patients could be successfully bridged to allogeneic HSCT [62]. Patients with FLT3 wild-type also responded to quizartinib, but to a lower extent (CRc rates of 31% and 32% for cohort I and cohort II, respectively). Overall, quizartinib was well tolerated, with manageable toxicities; adverse events included mainly gastrointestinal symptoms, reversible QT prolongation and myelosuppression, possibly related to KIT inhibition [61,62]. These data represent the highest level of single-agent activity observed to date for FLT3-targeted therapy in patients with relapsed/ refractory FLT3-ITD positive AML. The encouraging efficacy results as well as an acceptable safety profile in this population with high-risk AML support continued clinical evaluation in mono- and combination therapy as well as for maintenance after allogeneic HSCT (currently ongoing clinical trials are summarized in Table III).  Go to: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant In addition to TKIs, allogeneic HSCT seems to be clinically effective in patients with AML with FLT3 -ITD: both relapse-free and OS rates are significantly improved by allogeneic HSCT [33,63\\u2013 68]. Notably, the relapse risk after allogeneic HSCT could be reduced to roughly 30% [64,66,67,69]. The reported data suggest the existence of a strong anti-leukemic effect after myeloablative, but also after reduced-intensity conditioning in combination with a graft-versus-leukemia reaction. In contrast, in a single-center experience, a lower disease-free survival and increased risk of relapse after allogeneic HSCT in FLT3-ITD patients was reported as compared to patients with wild-type FLT3 [70]. However, the data might have been biased due to the low patient number and long median time to transplant, requiring several courses of chemotherapy before allogeneic HSCT. Within this survey of patients after allogeneic HSCT, any source of donor (including umbilical cord blood and haploidentical) had been used [70], which contrasts with other publications where the source of donor was restricted to matched-related or matched-unrelated donors [63,64,66,68,69]. Furthermore, almost half of the patients received reduced-intensity conditioning [70]. Therefore, these data should be interpreted cautiously. An overview of the outcome results for FLT3-ITD patients after allogeneic HSCT is given in Table IV. Yet again, the molecular characteristics of FLT3-ITD may further influence its prognostic impact even in the setting of allogeneic HSCT [71,72]. Recently presented data in FLT3-ITD positive AML suggest that a high allelic ratio and/or a FLT3-ITD insertion site in the \\u03b21-sheet of the FLT3 gene and, in particular, the presence of both seem to be associated with a very unfavorable prognosis, which could not be overcome by an allogeneic HSCT performed in first CR [72]. In contrast, allogeneic HSCT performed in first CR had a beneficial effect on relapse-free and OS in all other patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML [72]. Whether the recent introduction of FLT3 kinase inhibitors will significantly improve outcome after chemotherapy remains to be answered by ongoing clinical trials. TKIs may increase the proportion of patients with FLT3-ITD who achieve CR and reach allografting in the best condition. Therefore, FLT3 inhibitors may be a strategy early on in therapy to improve remission rate and to maintain patients in remission after allogeneic HSCT. Several ongoing clinical trials are now investigating this strategy (Table III).  Table IV Table IV Outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in FLT3-YID AML. Go to: Mechanisms of resistance during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors During therapy with FLT3 TKIs the induction of secondary FLT3 -TKD mutations seems to emerge in a substantial proportion of patients with FLT3-ITD AML, which is associated with loss of response [73,74]. The emergence of a FLT3-TKD during treatment with midostaurin had first been described in an index patient with AML by Heidel and colleagues [75] and has now been shown in several patients with AML who had been treated within the AC220-002 trial [73]. The FLT3 -TKD mutation might possibly lead to a change in the RTK structure, thus hampering the binding of the TKI and therefore leading to resistance similar to that described for resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [76]. Recently, it has been shown that different FLT3 TKIs, e.g. midostaurin, sorafenib and SU5614, displayed distinct and non-overlapping resistance profiles in FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines [77]. Interestingly, the profile of resistance mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain, predominantly exchanges of D835. In contrast, midostaurin exclusively produced mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain 1 at codon N676 [77], which is in line with the findings reported by Heidel and colleagues [75]. Similarly, in a cell based model, saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKIs revealed a growing number of FLT3 -TKD point mutations that are likely to contribute to TKI resistance [78]. Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to prevent the induction of resistance mutations. Very recently, preliminary encouraging results were presented for the TKI crenolanib [79], which showed activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FLT3 and is currently being tested in clinical trials on solid tumors. Strikingly, crenolanib displayed cytotoxic activity against primary AML cells from patients who had developed D835 resistance mutations during FLT3 TKI treatment. In vitro , the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) of crenolanib for inhibition of FLT3-ITD in plasma was 34 nM, and from pharmacokinetic studies of crenolanib in patients with solid tumors, steady state trough plasma levels of roughly 500 nM were found to be safe and tolerable [79]. A phase II study of crenolanib in relapsed or refractory patients with AML with FLT3 -TKD mutations at codon D835 started recruitment quite recently (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01522469). Similarly, the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor ponatinib (AP24534), primarily created to inhibit BCR \\u2013 ABL including the gatekeeper resistance mutation T315I [80], but also certain other tyrosine kinases including FLT3, showed promising activity not only in FLT3-ITD cell lines but also in transfected subclones harboring additional FLT3 -TKD point mutations (N676D, F691I or G697R) [81,82]. Additionally, there seems to be evidence of clinical activity in patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML: in a first phase I study on patients with relapsed or refractory AML the response rate was 43% (n = 3/7). All responses observed were in FLT3-ITD positive patients who were naive to FLT3 inhibitors [83]. Further evaluation of the activity of ponatinib in patients with AML with FLT3-ITD and/or acquired TKD resistance mutations may be warranted.  Besides ponatinib, the oral multi-targeted TKI PLX3397 showed potential activity against FLT3 , including the FLT3-TKD point mutation F691; however, it conferred cross-resistance to other quizartinib-resistant FLT3 -TKD point mutations, such as D835V/Y as well as Y842C/H [84]. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of PLX3397 in a phase I/II study in adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML is currently ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01349049).  Another mechanism of resistance might be related to the FLT3-ITD insertion site, since an insertion site outside the JM domain of the FLT3 receptor was shown to be associated with rewired signaling, resulting in an up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 [20]. This resulted in a significant reduction of apoptosis as well as resistance toward treatment with midostaurin. Decreasing MCL-1 expression levels by small interfering RNA knockdown resulted in rescue of TKI-sensitivity, indicating the pivotal role of MCL-1 in mediating resistance [20]. Clinically, a FLT3-ITD insertion site within the \\u03b21-sheet of the TKD1 was associated with an inferior outcome as compared to all other insertion sites, even after allogeneic HSCT [17,33]. Moreover, overexpression of survivin with concomitant activation of enhanced signaling pathways has been found to mediate resistance to FLT3 inhibition as well [85]. Enhanced signaling seems to be one mechanism to escape from inhibition of TKI treatment, since FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples showed continued activation of downstream PI3K/AKT and/or RAS/MEK/ MAPK signaling pathways as well as continued expression of genes involved in FLT3-mediated cellular transformation [86]. Inhibition of these downstream signaling pathways by PI3K or MEK inhibitors restored partial sensitivity to FLT3 TKIs [86]. Therefore, an approach combining FLT3 TKIs with anti-FLT3 antibodies and/or inhibitors of important pathways downstream of FLT3 may reduce the chances of developing resistance.  Stromal cells of the bone marrow environment may also contribute to resistance against TKIs due to a possible cyto-protective effect [87,88]. In a cell culture experiment, FLT3 inhibition did not induce apoptosis in FLT3-ITD AML blast cells after being cultured for several days on stroma [88]. Therefore, the bone marrow stroma may provide survival signals to FLT3-ITD AML blast cells, thus enabling survival despite the presence of potent FLT3 inhibition. ERK signaling was strongly activated in primary FLT3-ITD AML blast cells when the cells were co-cultured with stroma, and this activation was unaffected by FLT3 ligand or by FLT3 inhibition [88]. These observations may account for the difference in response to FLT3 inhibition observed between peripheral blood and bone marrow blast cells. Recent data suggest that a combination of FLT3 inhibitors and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors might be effective in overriding stromal protection and potentiating FLT3 inhibition [89].  One further clinically relevant aspect may simply be related to the timing of TKI therapy in relation to conventional chemotherapy regimens. The sequence of combination of TKI with chemotherapy may be important, since in vitro studies indicate that the use of TKI prior to chemotherapy results in antagonism, whereas the use of TKI adjacent to chemotherapy results in synergistic effects [47]. Furthermore, it has been shown that FLT3 ligand (FL) levels increase dramatically following intensive chemotherapy [90]. On the one hand, such increased FL levels appear to shift the cytotoxicity IC 50 of FLT3 inhibitors upward by 2 \\u2013 4-fold; on the other hand, FL up-regulation immediately after chemotherapy may be an important driver of residual FLT3-mutant cells, particularly if the inhibitor is only given intermittently. Clinical responses to FLT3 TKIs appear to be dependent upon sustained inhibition, as determined by the plasma inhibitory activity for FLT3, but this is a difficult obstacle to overcome when the agents are administered immediately following chemotherapy, when FL levels are highest \\u2013 and yet it may be the most important time period to try [91].  Go to: Conclusions Our progress in unraveling the heterogeneity of AML has allowed us to identify a number of potential molecular targets such as FLT3 , and has provided insight into the basis for the enormous diversity in the response to treatment. Complete and sustained inhibition of FLT3 -mutated AML will probably require a combination of agents, both targeted and conventional chemotherapy. The ongoing investigations into the mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibition will enable us to gain a deeper insight into the pathobiology of FLT3-ITD mutated AML and will probably continue to lead to the development of even more novel target-specific agents .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
