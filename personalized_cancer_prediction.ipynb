These small RNAs induce gene silencing known as RNA interference. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal RNase III domain (RNase IIIb) of human Dicer at 2.0 \\u00c5 resolution. The structure revealed that the RNase IIIb domain can form a tightly associated homodimer, which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial RNase III domains and the two RNase III domains of Giardia Dicer. Biochemical analysis showed that the RNase IIIb homodimer can cleave double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), and generate short dsRNAs with 2 nt 3\\u2032 overhang, which is characteristic of RNase III products. The RNase IIIb domain contained two magnesium ions per monomer around the active site. The distance between two Mg-1 ions is approximately 20.6 \\u00c5, almost identical with those observed in bacterial RNase III enzymes and Giardia Dicer, while the locations of two Mg-2 ions were not conserved at all. We presume that Mg-1 ions act as catalysts for dsRNA cleavage, while Mg-2 ions are involved in RNA binding.  Abbreviations used dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; Ec, Escherichia coli; Gi, Giardia intestinalis; dsRBD, dsRNA-binding domain; Aa, Aquifex aeolicus; Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Tm, Thermotoga maritima Keywords RNA interference; Dicer; RNase III enzyme; dsRNA; metal-binding protein Introduction In many eukaryotic cells, small RNAs trigger gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner. Dicer is responsible for the processing of long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into short interfering RNAs, and for the processing of precursor microRNAs into microRNAs.1,2 These small RNAs provide specificity to protein effector complexes that repress mRNA transcription or translation, or that catalyze mRNA degradation.1,2  Dicer homologues have been found in all eukaryotes studied, except for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In zebrafish and mouse, the Dicer protein is essential to normal development. 3,4 In Arabidopsis thaliana, mutants of dicer-like 1 (DCL1) show various phenotypic defects. 5 Analysis of recombinant human (Homo sapiens, Hs) Dicer indicated that the enzyme generates short interfering RNAs s from dsRNA, 6,7 and that it produces the mature let-7 RNA from the microRNA let-7 precursor.6 Dicers are approximately 200 kDa multidomain proteins that consist of an N-terminal DEXH-box helicase/ATPase domain, a domain of unknown function (DUF283), a PAZ domain, two RNase III nuclease domains (RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb), and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD). RNase III domain of Dicer appears to interact with the PIWI domain of Argonaute proteins in cells.8,9 Thus, the Dicer interactions with PIWI domains are considered to be involved in a substrate transfer.10  RNase III proteins are divided into three classes, and classes 1, 2, and 3 are represented by Escherichia coli (Ec) RNase III, Drosha, and Dicer, respectively. 11,12 Class 1 enzymes have one RNase III domain, whereas class 2 and class 3 enzymes have two RNase III domains (Figure 1(a)). To our knowledge, there is no report of the presence of class 1 enzymes in mammals. Biochemical and structural studies indicated that class 1 enzymes function as homodimers.11,12In vitro mutational analysis and gradient sedimentation analysis using recombinant Dicer have indicated the validity of a single processing center model for Hs-Dicer, which suggests that RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb in a Dicer molecule form two catalytic sites through intramolecular dimerization, analogous to the homodimerization of the bacterial RNase III. 13 In this model, the two catalytic sites, which cleave an RNA phosphodiester bond, generate RNA products with 2 nt 3\\u2032 overhangs. RBDs, dsRBD and PAZ assist the cleavage reaction. Recently, the crystal structure of a primitive form of Dicer from Giardia intestinalis (Gi) was determined and it was shown that two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer are capable of forming an intramolecular heterodimer. 14  Domain structure of the RNase III superfamily and sequence alignment of RNase ... Figure 1.  Domain structure of the RNase III superfamily and sequence alignment of RNase III domains. (a) Three classes of the RNase III superfamily. Class 3 is represented by human Dicer, class 2 by human Drosha, and class 1 by bacterial RNase III proteins. The green box represents the helicase domain, the yellow box represents DUF283 (domain of unknown function), the blue box represents the PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain, the red box represents the RNase III nuclease domain (RNase III domain), and the purple box represents dsRBD (dsRNA-binding domain). Class 2 and class 3 RNase III proteins have two tandem RNase III domains, RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb (RIIIa and RIIIb, respectively). We have determined the homodimeric structure of the RNase IIIb domain of human Dicer. (b) Sequence alignment of RNase III domains from Homo sapiens (Hs-Dicer, Hs-Drosha), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-Dicer-1, Dm-Dicer-2), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce-Dicer, Ce-Drosha), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp-Dicer, Sp-Pac1), Giardia intestinalis (Gi-Dicer), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc-Rnt1), Aquifex aeolicus (Aa-RNase III), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb-RNase III), Thermotoga maritima (Tm-RNase III), and Escherichia coli (Ec-RNase III). Conserved residues are shaded in blue (65% conservation) and yellow (85% conservation), and invariant residues are shaded in red. The secondary structure of the RNase IIIb domain is shown above the sequence. A broken line indicates residues 1780\\u20131799, for which no electron density was observed. Red triangles show the metal-ion binding residues, and asterisks (*) show the residues involved in the dimerization. Motifs I and II, which are conserved sequences unique to the RNase III domains of Dicers, 21 are shaded in orange. The residues unique to the RNase IIIb domains of Dicers are shaded in purple. The acidic residues in the insert regions of Dicers are shaded in green. A pink line indicates the region deleted in mutant RNase IIIb-\\u039413. Figure options RNase III enzymes require divalent metal ions, with Mg2+ as the preferred species.12 The Mg2+-dependent activity of RNase III is consistent with that of Hs-Dicer.6,7 The crystal structure of the RNase III nuclease domain from Aquifex aeolicus (Aa), which is complexed with Mg2+ or Mn2+ in each monomer, provided the first structural information for the active site.11,15 On the other hand, kinetic and inhibitor analysis of Ec-RNase III indicates the involvement of two magnesium ions in RNA phosphodiester hydrolysis.16 The crystal structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) RNase III nuclease domain in its complex with two calcium ions per monomer showed that one calcium ion (Ca-A) binds at a position similar to that of the magnesium ion of Aa-RNase III, and the second (Ca-2\\u00b0) binds near the active site. 17 In the Gi-Dicer structure, a second metal ion (M2) was observed in the active site, which is assumed to play a direct role in catalysis.14 Recent structural analyses of RNase III enzymes have been summarized and reviewed. 18.; 19. ;  20.  Here, we report the crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer at 2.0 \\u00c5 resolution. The structure revealed that the RNase IIIb domain can form a tightly associated homodimer, which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial RNase III domains and the two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer. The RNase IIIb domain binds two magnesium ions per monomer at or near the active sites. Mg-1 is coordinated by three of four invariant amino acids, and the distance between two Mg-1 ions in the homodimer is approximately 20.6 \\u00c5, almost identical with those of dsRNA-free forms of RNase III proteins (20.2\\u201321.6 \\u00c5). Further, biochemical analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb homodimer can process dsRNAs into shorter dsRNAs similar in terminal structure and size to the products of bacterial RNase III enzymes.  Results Overall structure  The crystal structure of RNase IIIb has been determined at 2.0 \\u00c5 resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.211 and Rfree of 0.234 (Table 1). The crystals of the RNase IIIb domain belonged to space group C2221, and contained three molecules (molecules A, B, and C) of the RNase IIIb domain in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The final model includes residues 1660\\u20131779 and 1800\\u20131850 for molecule A, residues 1660\\u20131779 and 1800\\u20131849 for molecule B, and residues 1660\\u20131779 and 1800\\u20131848 for molecule C. There is no electron density for residues 1780\\u20131799 in any of three molecules.

A negatively charged valley is generated by the dimerization of the RNase IIIb monomers (Figure 2(b)), and four magnesium ions are located in the valley. The residues forming the valley are well-conserved among RNase III enzymes (Figure 2(c)).  Structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer. (a) Stereoview of the ribbon ... Figure 2.

Figure options To date, three structures of bacterial RNase III enzymes have been determined (Aa-RNase III11; Mtb-RNase III17; Thermotoga maritima (Tm) RNase III, PDB ID 1O0W), and recently, the structure of Gi-Dicer was determined.14 The backbone structure of the RNase IIIb domain monomer was superimposed on Aa-RNase III, Mtb-RNase III, and Tm-RNase III, with r.m.s. deviations of 1.18 \\u00c5 (for 125 C\\u03b1 atoms), 1.15 \\u00c5 (for 127 C\\u03b1 atoms), and 1.25 \\u00c5 (for 126 C\\u03b1 atoms), respectively, and was superimposed on the RNase IIIa domain and the RNase IIIb domain of Gi-Dicer, with r.m.s. deviations of 1.30 \\u00c5 (for 96 C\\u03b1 atoms) and 1.34 \\u00c5 (for 106 C\\u03b1 atoms), respectively (the superposition of RNase IIIb domains is shown in Figure 2(d)).  The helix \\u03b16 and the subsequent disordered region correspond to the insert region of the RNase III domains of Dicers (Figures 1(b) and 2(a)). In this region, the RNase IIIa domain and RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer encode 177 residues (residues 1374\\u20131550) and 37 residues (residues 1763\\u20131799), respectively.  Homodimerization of the RNase IIIb domain  The structure of the RNase IIIb domain shows a tightly associated homodimer. Gel-filtration chromatographic analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb domain exists as a stable dimer in solution (data not shown). The dimer interface is composed of the antiparallel helices \\u03b13 and \\u03b14, the C terminus of \\u03b17, and the N terminus of \\u03b18. Dimerization is accomplished primarily through hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3(a)). Three aromatic residues, F1706, Y1714 and Y1721, contribute to the dimerization via hydrophobic interactions. F1706 interacts with T1717, L1732 and R1736, whereas Y1714 interacts with I1711 and L1827, and Y1721 interacts with R1703 and L1707. These aromatic residues are buried along the dimer interface. Among RNase III proteins, F1706 is highly conserved, except for RNase IIIa domain. Y1721 is highly conserved as aromatic amino acids. Y1714 is highly conserved within RNase IIIb domains of Dicers ( Figure 1(b)). In the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer, M1317, H1325 and F1332 correspond to F1706, Y1714 and Y1721, respectively.

(d) Stereoview of the motif II-NT (cyan) and the motif II-CT (yellow), showing L1765, V1768, F1772, F1775, I1802, E1803, and P1805. The pink broken line indicates the flexible region, containing 20 amino acid residues. Figure options In addition to hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds are observed in the dimer interface. R1703 forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl groups of Y1721 and H1727. R1736 also forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl group of F1706. The hydroxyl group of Y1714 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Y1820. R1703 is highly conserved, while R1736 is conserved as basic amino acids, Arg or Lys (Figure 1(b)). In the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer, R1314, H1325 and R1347, respectively, correspond to R1703, Y1714 and R1736.  The homodimeric structure is similar to those of homodimers of bacterial RNase III proteins and a dimer of two RNase III domains of Gi-Dicer (Figure 3(b) and (c)).

The N-terminal motif II (motif II-NT) is composed of the following sequence, PXLXXVIXXFVXFQ (1763\\u20131776), and the C-terminal motif II (motif II-CT) is composed of the following sequence, EDIEVP (1800\\u20131805). The motif II-NT forms the helix \\u03b16, which is anchored to the surface of the RNase III domain by hydrophobic interactions between L1765, V1768, I1769, F1772, V1773, and F1775 of motif II-NT, and I1802, E1803, and P1805 of motif II-CT ( Figure 3(d)). In the overall structure, the helix \\u03b16 adds to the helix bundle conformation and appears to be rigid in structure. Intriguingly, the helix \\u03b16 increases the depth of the valley (\\u223c18 \\u00c5) as compared to bacterial RNase III (\\u223c13 \\u00c5). The acidic amino acid-rich region between the motif II-NT and motif II-CT was not observed in the electron density, indicating that this portion of RNase IIIb is highly flexible. Almost all the RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb domains of Dicers contain acidic amino acid-rich regions, whose function remains to be elucidated (Figure 1(b)). This region of Gi-Dicer is shorter than those of higher eukaryotic Dicers and forms a short loop (Figure 2(d)).  dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain  The structure of the RNase IIIb domain suggests that the homodimer has the ability to cleave dsRNAs. Thus, the dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain was assessed with long (114 bp) dsRNA substrates in the presence of magnesium ions. This analysis indicated that the RNase IIIb domain can indeed cleave dsRNA substrates with the extent of cleavage dependent on the protein concentration (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The lengths of the products were shorter than 21 bp dsRNA, a typical size of the short interfering RNA generated by Dicer. In analysis of the cleavage products, the activity of the isolated RNase IIIb domain has been found to be similar to that of the bacterial RNase III enzyme22 rather than that of full-length Dicers (Figure 4(c)).

Thus, synthetic RNA oligonucleotides with 3\\u2032-OH can be used for markers. The lower images show cleavage patterns of the substrates.

Figure options The properties of a truncated form of Ec-RNase III lacking the dsRBD (Ec-RNase III nuclease domain) have been analyzed,23 and the dsRBD is assumed to provide substrate-binding affinity under physiological conditions.12 Analysis using recombinant Dicers showed that the Hs-Dicer lacking dsRBD reduces the dsRNA cleavage activity.13 To investigate the influence of the attachment of dsRBD on the catalytic activity, we prepared the RNase IIIb-dsRBD and assessed its dsRNA cleavage activity. As with RNase IIIb, the RNase IIIb-dsRBD protein was a homodimer in solution by gel-filtration analysis (our unpublished results). This analysis showed that RNase IIIb-dsRBD can cleave dsRNA substrates approximately 100 times more efficiently than the RNase IIIb domain (Figure 4(a) and (b)). This number was estimated from the almost-identical patterns of lane 8 of Figure 4(a) with lane 4 of Figure 4(b), as analyzed using the ImageJ software (NIH).  Processing of short dsRNA substrate by the RNase IIIb domain  To map sites cleaved by the RNase IIIb homodimer, labeled short (21 bp) dsRNAs were used in the reaction. The RNase IIIb homodimer cleaved 21 bp dsRNAs near the central region (Figure 4(d)). The major cleavage sites indicated that the RNase IIIb homodimer generates short dsRNAs with 2 nt 3\\u2032 overhang, the characteristic products generated by RNase III enzymes, including human Dicer and Drosha.12,13,24 This analysis indicated that RNase IIIb processes dsRNA substrates into fragments with 2 nt 3\\u2032 overhang end.  Active site  Magnesium ions are essential to the nuclease activity of bacterial RNase III, Dicers,6,7,12,14 and the isolated RNase IIIb domain (data not shown). Our structural analysis showed that four magnesium ions bind to the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer. These magnesium ions located on the valley are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen ligands with an Mg\\u2013O distance of approximately 2.2 \\u00c5 (Figure 5(a)). The magnesium ions located at the both ends of the valley were assigned to Mg-1, and the ions located at the middle of the valley were assigned to Mg-2 (Figure 5(b)). The distances between the two Mg-1 sites in two homodimers (B-B\\u2032 and A-C dimers, see Figure 5(b)) are 20.5 \\u00c5 and 20.7 \\u00c5, and the distances between the Mg-1 and Mg-2 sites in the three monomers (A, B and C molecules) are 7.5\\u20137.7 \\u00c5. The distances between the metal ions at Mg-1 sites among dsRNA-free forms of RNase III proteins are 20.2\\u201321.6 \\u00c5 (Table 3), indicating that the distance between the Mg-1 sites in the RNase IIIb homodimer is essentially identical with the catalytic-metal-pair distance in the RNase III enzymes.

E1813 also interacts with one of the three water molecules, and D1709 interacts with one of the three coordinated water molecules of the Mg-1 ion. Mg-2 is coordinated directly by the carboxylate oxygen atom of D1709 and by four water molecules (Figure 5(b)). One of the coordinated water molecules exhibits weak density. D1709 also interacts with one of the four water molecules. Two residues of D1713 positioned at the center of homodimeric structure interact with the coordinated water molecules (Figure 5(b)). The D1713 residues in the three molecules of the asymmetric unit have two different conformations (Figure 5(b)). The D1713 residues in molecules A and B involve the binding of one Mg-2 ion, whereas the D1713 residue in molecule C involves the binding of both Mg-2 ions. The residues E1705, D1709, D1810, and E1813 are highly conserved. In contrast, D1713, which is involved indirectly in the Mg-2 coordination, is highly conserved only within the Dicer RNase IIIb domains except for the Gi-Dicer RNase IIIb. The residue D1713 corresponds to K1324 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer (Figure 1(b)).  The Mg-1 site of RNase IIIb is identical with the site of the magnesium ion of Aa-RNase III, and the M1 site of Gi-Dicer (Figure 5).14,15 The Mg-1 site is similar to the Ca-A site of Mtb-RNase III.17 The Mg-2 site of RNase IIIb structure is located at the inner region of the valley, similar to the M2 site of Gi-Dicer (compare Figure 5(b) and (c)). The residue D1713 contributes to the strong binding of Mg-2, thus the ion is observed at a lower concentration of magnesium ions, compared to the crystallization condition of Gi-Dicer. Since the residue D1713 of RNase IIIb involves the binding of Mg-2, the Mg-2 is further away from the Mg-1 site compared to the M2 site of Gi-Dicer.  In the structure of Mtb-RNase III, Ca-2\\u00b0, an additional calcium ion, is bound near the active site. The Ca-2\\u00b0 site is located at the outer region of the valley, and it is similar to the M3 site of Gi-Dicer (Figure 5(c)). These metal ions at the M3 site are thought to be involved in the substrate binding.17 In contrast, the crystal structure of the Aa-RNase III-product complex indicated that the residue E64, which is thought to bind to metal ion, forms a hydrogen bond with a phosphate oxygen atom.25 Residue E64 of Aa-RNase III corresponds to P1729 in the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer, thus the residue of RNase IIIb binds to neither a metal ion nor an RNA substrate (Figures 1(b) and 5(b)).  dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb domain mutants  To assess the effects of residues coordinated to metal ions, the RNase IIIb mutants E1705A, D1709A, D1713A, D1810A, E1813A, and D1713K were prepared. In the case of heterodimer formation between the RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb domains, K1324 of RNase IIIa is the counterpart of D1713 of RNase IIIb. This analysis indicated that the mutations E1705A, D1709A, D1810A, and E1813A apparently reduced the dsRNA cleavage activity (Figure 6). In particular, mutations D1709A and E1813A were greatly decreased in dsRNA cleavage activity. The differing effects of the RNase IIIb mutants on the cleavage activity are consistent with those of Ec-RNase III mutants.11,12,26,27 On the other hand, mutations D1713A and D1713K did not have a significant effect on the cleavage activity (Figure 6). These results indicate that the Mg-1 ion of RNase IIIb has an important role in its catalysis, and the Mg-2 ion might be dispensable for the cleavage reaction. However, the exact role of the Mg-2 is unknown. The results support a model, consistent with the data, of the complex between a dsRNA substrate and the RNase IIIb homodimer (see Discussion).  dsRNA cleavage activity of mutants. dsRNA cleavage activity of the RNase IIIb ...

Figure options In addition, to investigate the effect of the insertion sequence, the deletion mutant RNase IIIb-\\u039413 (deleted residues 1787\\u20131799) was prepared. The analysis of the mutant RNase IIIb-\\u039413 showed that the deletion has no apparent effect on the cleavage activity (Figure 6). This result suggests that the flexible region does not contribute to recognition of the dsRNA substrate, and does not affect cleavage.  Discussion Dimerization of the RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer  The results presented here show that the RNase IIIb domain, a C-terminal RNase III domain of Hs-Dicer, forms a stable homodimer. The homodimerization of the isolated RNase IIIb of Dicer differs from the heterodimerization between RNase IIIa and RNase IIIb, which was previously established on the basis of the results of biochemical analysis of Hs-Dicer and structural analysis of Gi-Dicer.13,14 Our biochemical analysis also indicated that the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer is an active RNase III enzyme capable of cleaving dsRNA. Structural analysis described herein (Figures 3(b) and (c); Table 2; and see below) indicated that the structural basis for the dimerization is strictly conserved, and must be necessary to maintain the appropriate positions of two metal ions at the Mg-1 sites, spaced 20\\u201322 \\u00c5 apart, and necessary to provide binding sites for dsRNA, as seen in the complex structure of Aa-RNase III-dsRNA.25 For this reason, the in vitro RNase III activity found in the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb homodimer might be fortuitous due to the isolation of the domain.  The residues forming the dimer interface are located on \\u03b13, \\u03b14, \\u03b17, and \\u03b18 (Figure 1(b)). In particular, the residues within \\u03b13 and \\u03b14 are highly conserved. The aromatic residues F1706 and Y1721 contribute to strengthening the dimerization. F1706 corresponds to M1317 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer. Previous mutation analysis of Ec-RNase III has indicated that the mutant F40M, corresponding to F1706 and M1317 in RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer, is functional.11 Thus, residue M1317 in the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer can maintain its activity. In addition, other residues forming hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface could be replaced with the residues at homologous positions of the RNase IIIa domain of Hs-Dicer, as mentioned previously.13  As described above, the dimer interfaces of RNase III proteins must fundamentally share a common structural feature. Our modeling analysis of the dimerization of RNase IIIb and RNase IIIa, which is based on the Hs-Dicer RNase IIIb structure, also suggested that the two RNase III domains of Hs-Dicer could form a heterodimer with the similar dimer interface (Figure 7(a)).

The scissile phosphodiester bonds, which generate 2 nt 3\\u2032 overhang ends, are indicated by arrows. Figure options Metal ions and catalytic activity  Previous mutational analysis of Ec-RNase III and structural analysis of Aa-RNase III suggested that the Mg-1 ion is involved in dsRNA cleavage.11.; 23.; 26.; 28. ;  29. E110 of Aa-RNase III, corresponding to E117 of Ec-RNase III, binds to Mg-1 through a bidentate interaction, and the mutation of the homologous position of Ec-RNase III abolishes the dsRNA cleavage activity.11,28 Our structural and biochemical analyses showed that E1813 of the RNase IIIb domain corresponds to E110 of Aa-RNase III, and has an essential role in catalysis. Thus, the homologous residues in RNase III enzymes may be fundamentally important for their catalysis through the metal ion binding.  Mg-2 is coordinated directly by D1709, and indrectly by D1713 through a water molecule. D1709 also binds to the two water molecules bound to Mg-2 and Mg-1, respectively. Mutation of D45 of Ec-RNase III, corresponding to D44 of Aa-RNase III, abolishes the dsRNA cleavage activity.11,12 Our results indicated that D1709, corresponding to D44 of Aa-RNase III, plays an important role in the catalysis. The structure of Gi-Dicer, which lacks the acidic residue corresponding to D1713, showed that the additional metal ion (M2) can bind near the Mg-2 site in the presence of a high concentration of MnCl2. Due to the metal binding around the Mg-2 and M2 sites, residue D1709 might have a critical role in the catalysis. However, it is unclear whether the M2 ion in Gi-Dicer and the Mg-2 ion in RNase IIIb have the same role in the catalysis, because the positions of M2 and Mg-2 sites are distinctly different in detail (Figure 5(b) and (c)).  The environment of metal ions around the active sites may be diversified among RNase III enzymes. The involvement of two-metal ions in Ec-RNase III catalysis has been suggested.16 The distance of 7.6 \\u00c5 between the Mg-1 and Mg-2 sites in the RNase IIIb structure is inconsistent with a two-metal-ion mechanism.30,31 In the active sites of RNase H,32 the ASV integrase,33 the EcoRV,34 and the group I intron,35 which are thought to use the two-metal-ion mechanism, there are two metal ions spaced 3.6\\u20134.2 \\u00c5 apart. If the Mg-2 functions as one of the two catalytic metal ions, some movement may be required. Transposition of metal ions for catalytic reaction has been observed in EcoRV-DNA complex structures.36  A model for dsRNA cleavage by the RNase IIIb domain  Our structural and biochemical analyses of the RNase IIIb domain enable us to build a robust model of the complex between the RNase IIIb and the A-form dsRNA substrate ( Figure 7(b)). In this model, we hypothesize that the Mg-1 ion is responsible for activation of the water nucleophile, as suggested.13,16 On the basis of the structure of the 3\\u2032-5\\u2032 exonuclease active site30 and the RNase H active site,32 the Mg-1 positions at both ends were placed at stereochemically reasonable sites. The model is similar to the crystal structure of Aa-RNase III complexed with dsRNA products,25 except for the vertical distance between the RNase III enzyme and the dsRNA substrate (in the left-hand image in Figure 7(b)). A straight A-form dsRNA collided with the N terminus of \\u03b16 of RNase IIIb, indicating that some conformational changes of a dsRNA and/or the RNase IIIb protein may be required for the catalytic reaction. For this reason, a slightly curved dsRNA was used in this model, in which two Mg-2 ions are located near the RNA minor groove between the cleavage sites; thus, the Mg-2 may contribute to RNA binding by neutralizing the negative charge of the protein valley ( Figure 2(b)).  Insert region of the RNase III domains of Dicers  In our model, the structure of the motif II was close to the active site and a dsRNA substrate (Figure 7(b)). Our biochemical analysis of the mutant RNase IIIb-\\u039413 showed that the acidic amino acid-rich region has no apparent effect on the cleavage activity. Therefore, the region could provide some unidentified function(s) to Dicer RNase IIIb domains of higher eukaryotes without significant effect on the cleavage activity. A possibility is that the region interacts with other protein factors involved in the gene-silencing pathway, according to the experimental results showing that both RNase III domains of Dicer interact with the PIWI box.9 In our analysis, the cleavage activity of RNase IIIb enzyme is approximately 100 times weaker than that of Ec-RNase III (our unpublished results). Furthermore, recombinant full-length Hs-Dicer exhibits a remarkably low level of activity.7,13 One of the reasons for the low level of activity of Hs-Dicer may be the additional helix \\u03b16 formed by motif II, which is assumed to interrupt dsRNA binding.  Conclusions The crystal structure of the RNase IIIb domain of Hs-Dicer showed that it forms a stable homodimer, similar to the dimerization of other RNase III enzymes. Further, the RNase IIIb homodimer can cleave dsRNA into shorter dsRNA fragments with 2 nt 3\\u2032 overhang ends. These results may indicate that Dicer RNase III domains are capable of forming homodimer and heterodimer, both with RNase III enzyme activity. This analysis provides the first structural view of Hs-Dicer, suggesting that the RNase III domain has strictly conserved the structural bases needed to process dsRNA substrates. The RNase III domain has evolved, in part, its structural features probably to function in the gene-silencing pathway.\",\n          \"Mutation screening of the breast and ovarian cancer\\u2013predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice. Classification of rare nontruncating sequence variants in these genes is problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Using data from the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database of nearly 70,000 full-sequence tests, we assessed the clinical significance of 1,433 sequence variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the BRCA genes. Three independent measures were employed in the assessment: co-occurrence in trans of a VUS with known deleterious mutations; detailed analysis, by logistic regression, of personal and family history of cancer in VUS-carrying probands; and, in a subset of probands, an analysis of cosegregation with disease in pedigrees. For each of these factors, a likelihood ratio was computed under the hypothesis that the VUSs were equivalent to an \\u201caverage\\u201d deleterious mutation, compared with neutral, with respect to risk. The likelihood ratios derived from each component were combined to provide an overall assessment for each VUS. A total of 133 VUSs had odds of at least 100:1 in favor of neutrality with respect to risk, whereas 43 had odds of at least 20:1 in favor of being deleterious. VUSs with evidence in favor of causality were those that were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to be located in specific domains of the proteins. In addition to their utility for improved genetics counseling of patients and their families, the global assessment reported here will be invaluable for validation of functional assays, structural models, and in silico analyses.Sequence-based testing for BRCA1 (MIM 113705) and BRCA2(MIM 600185) mutations is now widely available through both commercial laboratories and research studies. Whereas thousands of BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncating mutations have been associated with increased risk of cancer in carriers, the contribution of other BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequence variants to cancer risk remains largely undefined. These \\u201cvariants of unknown significance\\u201d (VUSs) are mainly missense mutations but also include a number of intronic variants and inframe deletions and insertions (IFDIs). The open-access online Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) Database, which functions as a repository of sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, contains >1,500 distinct sequence variants that are currently reported as having unknown clinical significance. To date, classification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUSs as cancer predisposing or neutral has proven problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter the function of the proteins sufficiently to predispose to cancer. Determination of their disease relevance on the basis of population or family studies has also proved difficult, because most of the alleles encoding these mutations are very rare and, in some cases, population specific. Although identified in a minority (5%\\u201310%) of individuals tested clinically, the number of such tests performed annually worldwide means that a large number of women (and their families) are affected by the VUS issue. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that minority ethnic populations are disproportionately affected. VUSs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes pose significant problems, because patients and physicians do not know whether the VUSs predispose to cancer or are neutral with respect to cancer risk. As a result, carriers of VUSs and their family members cannot take advantage of the risk assessment, prevention, and therapeutic measures that are available to carriers of known deleterious truncating mutations. 1 In addition, carriers of VUSs are sometimes counseled to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy or mastectomy because of the presence of the VUS, but in the absence of any knowledge of the cancer relevance of the VUS. For these reasons, the determination of the clinical relevance of VUSs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become an important clinical issue. Although the focus of this article is on BRCA1 and BRCA2, similar concerns and issues are found in virtually all complex, genetically heterogeneous diseases for which genetic testing is performed\\u2014for example, colon cancer associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes. 2To address the problem of defining which VUSs are deleterious/disease causing and which are neutral, various types of evidence and classification schemes have been proposed.3; 4 ;  5 These include formal assessment of the cosegregation of the variant with disease in pedigrees,6; 7 ;  8 co-occurrence of the variant in question in trans with a known deleterious mutation, 9 and a number of in silico approaches that evaluate phylogenetic conservation and severity of the amino acid substitution. 10; 11 ;  12 In studies of other genes, evolutionary sequence-conservation analysis involving protein multiple-sequence alignments have been used to show that missense variants (MVs) at highly conserved/invariant residues are more often deleterious, whereas highly variable changes are more likely neutral. 13 ;  14 For BRCA1, Abkevich et al.10 developed a predictive algorithm that combines a measure of cross-species conservation, including nonmammalian BRCA1 sequences, with a measure of the degree of chemical change in amino acids, 15 to identify 50 putative deleterious BRCA1 missense mutations.A number of VUSs have been examined, in terms of their effect on protein, with use of functional assays. Efforts in this area have focused on BRCA1 mutations in the two C-terminal BRCT domains, 16 ;  17 which assess the transcriptional activation activity of the BRCT domains with use of mammalian and yeast-based models, 18; 19 ;  20 and on the E3 ligase activity associated with the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain of BRCA1.21 Examination of BRCA2 function has focused on assays of homology-directed repair and centrosome amplification in response to ectopic expression of full-length, wild-type VUS containing BRCA2 protein.22 Recently, crystal structures of the BRCA1 BRCT and BRCA2 DNA-binding domains have been used to predict that a number of VUSs predispose to cancer, 23; 24 ;  25 but genetic evidence suggests that some of these predictions are incorrect. Although none of the approaches described above have successfully been used to classify the clinical relevance of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs, a number have shown promise in this regard. The development of methods based on functional assays, crystal structure, phylogenetic and sequence analyses, and other approaches has been hampered by the absence of a large number of VUSs that have been proven to be either deleterious or neutral on the basis of direct genetic evidence that can be used in validation of these various assays.In this article, we examine the genetic evidence for or against disease causality for a large number of variants, with use of a large database of tested individuals collected by Myriad Genetic Laboratories. In addition to analysis of co-occurrence of VUSs with established deleterious mutations and the analysis of VUS cosegregation in individual pedigrees, we apply a novel analysis of personal and family cancer history, using data on >70,000 individuals, to assess the clinical significance of 1,433 distinct sequence variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.MethodsSource of Data and Variants AnalyzedThe data analyzed for this article come from the large database of full-sequence testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, performed at Myriad Genetic Laboratories. Since our primary focus was on the analysis of personal and family history, we began with all 70,071 individuals receiving full-sequence tests as of December 2005. To avoid potential confusion over which part of the personal/family history was due to which variant, this data set was reduced by eliminating all individuals who had more than one reported sequence variant (including both VUS and pathogenic mutations), which resulted in a set of 61,270 individuals with at most a single BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variant. We then divided the family history data set into several ethnic groups, since we postulated that probands of different ethnic backgrounds are expected to present with different distributions of mutations and different distributions of personal and family histories of cancer. After examining the data set with use of some preliminary logistic regressions to examine heterogeneity as a function of reported ethnicity, we constructed three separate groups that had similar family-history and mutation-prevalence profiles. These groups were: (a) western European, central/eastern European, other/none specified, Native American, and Asian; (b) Ashkenazi Jewish; and (c) Latin American/Caribbean and African American. In the first group, 72% were of European ancestry, 24% did not specify an ethnicity, and 4% were reported as of Asian, Middle Eastern, or Native American origin. Individual probands who reported mixed ancestry between these broad groups (e.g., Western European and Caribbean) were not included in the final data set, leaving 60,529 individual probands for analyses of family history. Table 1 shows the distribution by ethnicity and testing results of these individuals. A total of 1,433 distinct unclassified variants in 4,623 tested probands were identified through sequencing and are the subject of this article.Table 1.Results of Full BRCA Sequence Analysis of 60,529 Tested ProbandsNo. (%) of Subjects with GenotypeEthnic Group\\tWild Type\\tNeutral\\tVUS\\tBRCA1 Deletion\\tBRCA2 DeletionEuropeana\\t41,899 (78.6)\\t1,993 (3.7)\\t3,972 (7.5)\\t3,102 (5.8)\\t2,334 (4.4)Ashkenazi Jewish\\t3,622 (80.6)\\t381 (8.5)\\t258 (5.7)\\t139 (3.1)\\t91 (2.0)African American/Caribbean\\t\\u20021,667 (60.9)\\t398 (14.5)\\t393 (14.3)\\t176 (6.4)\\t104 (3.8)\\u2003Total\\t47,188 (78.0)\\t2,772 (4.6)\\t4,623 (7.6)\\t3,417 (5.6)\\t2,529 (4.2)aSee the text for the description of ethnicity for this group.Table optionsAs before,3 we assumed that all variants can be classified as deleterious mutations (M) or neutral variants (V). Our aim was to calculate a likelihood ratio (LR) of the formView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onfor each variant, given the available data. These ratios (or Bayes factors) can be combined with prior probabilities to obtain an absolute probability that each variant is deleterious. In this work, we first focused on the data sources that are most straightforwardly quantifiable from pedigree data: co-occurrence with known deleterious mutations, family history, and cosegregation. These three sources of data are independent, and the LR can therefore be derived by multiplying the LRs from the three components. We then used an admixture model to examine the influence of the type of mutation.Co-Occurrence with Known Deleterious MutationsTo include information on the co-occurrence of a VUS in trans phase with a deleterious mutation as evidence against the variant being disease causing, we followed the likelihood-ratio calculation described in our previous work. 3 We assumed that, for BRCA1, compound heterozygotes for two deleterious mutations are vanishingly rare (occur in the testing population with a frequency of 1 in 10,000), given both biological and genetic evidence that homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for deleterious BRCA1 mutations are embryonically lethal, 26 ;  27 whereas, for BRCA2, we assumed that the probability is 1 in 1,000, the increased frequency reflecting the fact that viable compound heterozygotes have been reported as Fanconi anemia, type D1. 28 ;  29 For these analyses, we used an updated data set based on \\u223c100,000 tests with observed frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations of 6.6% and 5.0%, respectively. The phase of the VUS with an observed deleterious mutation was determined through examination of haplotypes of common polymorphisms known in other examples of each variant or when the VUS and the deleterious mutation were in the same PCR fragment, as determined by direct examination of the sequence traces. In some cases, phase could not be determined, and we assumed that the first deleterious mutation was in cis phase and that subsequent different deleterious mutations were in trans phase. The LR for deleterious versus neutral is expressed asView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere n is the total number of times the variant was observed, k is the number of those that were in trans with a known deleterious mutation, p1 is the overall frequency of pathogenic mutations in the data set, and p2 is the probability of being a compound heterozygote for two pathogenic mutations (e.g., p1=0.066 and p2=1/10,000).Of the 1,433 VUSs studied here, 476 were observed at least five times, and 248 had at least 10 occurrences. Of the 1,433 variants, 44 were observed to occur with at least one deleterious mutation.Classification by Personal and Family History of Tested ProbandsWe developed likelihood models on the basis of family history,3 which, given the availability of the large Myriad Genetic Laboratories data set, is an extremely powerful tool for classification of VUSs. The method is based on the difference in personal and family-history profiles between individuals found to carry a true deleterious mutation and those with a wild-type BRCA sequence. The rationale is that mutation prevalence is known to be strongly dependent on certain key factors (e.g., disease status of the proband, age at diagnosis, and number and age of relatives with breast cancer [BRCA] or ovarian cancer), so these characteristics should also predict the probability of a new disease-causing missense mutation, whereas that of a neutral mutation should be independent of family history.We suppose that we have a set of probands drawn from a population with a certain distribution of family history. Suppose first that family history is classified into n types. Let pj be the probability that an individual with a mutation has family history type j, whereas qj is the corresponding probability for neutral variants. For a VUS that is deleterious, the predicted distribution of family history should be the same as that for known pathogenic mutations. The LR for a VUS with family history in category j drawn from the same population is thereforeView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere {FH} is the set of all family histories in the study population. In theory, the probabilities pj and qj could be calculated from the proportions of individuals with each category of family history who are found to carry a deleterious mutation. In practice, however, there are large numbers of possible constellations of family history, and the numbers of mutations in some categories would be very small. Instead, we estimated these probabilities by fitting a logistic-regression model. Thus, we fitted a model in which the outcome was the occurrence of a deleterious mutation versus a normal sequence, and summaries of personal and family history were included as covariates.This model then provides predicted probabilities rk that individual k is a mutation carrier, given his or her FH, isrk=P(M|{FH}k)\\u2009\\u200a\\u200a.Turn MathJax onLet r0 be the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis that the mutation is unrelated to family history or, equivalently, the prior probability of a deleterious mutation in the population. This is estimated by the overall proportion of individuals who have a deleterious mutation (rather than a normal sequence). For example, with use of the data in table 1, for the European group for BRCA1,View the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThenView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onandView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onTherefore, the required LR isView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onthat is, the odds ratio (OR) of the predicted probability that the individual with the given family history is a mutation carrier against the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis. Where there are multiple individuals with the same VUS, the LRs can be multiplied. We note that this formulation implicitly assumes that all pathogenic mutations in the same gene confer identical risks\\u2014that is, that there is no allelic heterogeneity.To implement this analysis, the logistic-regression model was fitted separately for each ethnic group and separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2. To construct a predictive model to be applied to the VUS probands, we used a logistic-regression model within each ethnic group, comparing the personal and family histories of individuals with known deleterious sequences versus those with normal sequences.

The predicted probabilities pk were obtained using the \\u201cpredict\\u201d option in STATA.As a simple validation of the process outline above, we examined the family history ORs for the known deleterious variants. Of the 1,106 distinct deleterious variants examined, 123 had odds of >100:1 in favor of being deleterious, 216 had odds of >10:1, and no known variants were excluded at this same threshold. Although we recognize that these summaries may overstate the model\\u2019s out-of-sample predictive ability, since the deleterious variants were used to construct the logistic regressions, they do provide reassurance that, in general, the method is performing as we expected. Further confirmation of this is obtained by looking at the similar calculation for 44 variants already classified as neutral and not used in either the logistic regression or in the subsequent analysis of VUSs. Of these 44 variants, 33 had odds against being deleterious of >100:1, and the other 11 all had odds against being deleterious of a lesser magnitude.Cosegregation of VUSs in PedigreesElsewhere, we developed a general-pedigree likelihood method for evaluating cosegregation of variants with disease in families that can be used to assess disease causality for unclassified sequence variants.6 The pedigree likelihood is evaluated under the hypothesis that the variant under consideration has the same penetrance as the \\u201caverage\\u201d known deleterious mutation, compared with the hypothesis that the variant segregates independent of disease in the pedigree(s) under study.As part of an effort to assess the clinical significance of VUSs, individuals found, through the full-sequence testing by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, to carry a VUS are offered free testing of additional family members on a research basis. These additional individuals can be unaffected or affected with BRCA or ovarian cancer and can be male or female. Typically, only 10% of individual probands with VUS provide such samples, and, in most cases, only one or two samples per family are obtained. The pedigree information available in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database is somewhat descriptive in nature, and, for this reason, we used a simplified model of BRCA1/2 penetrance, with seven liability classes corresponding to (1) unaffected and aged <20 years (or male), (2) unaffected and aged 21\\u201349 years, (3) unaffected and aged \\u2a7e50 years, (4) affected with BRCA at age <50 years, (5) affected with BRCA at age \\u2a7e50, (6) affected with ovarian cancer at age <50, and (7) affected with ovarian cancer at age \\u2a7e50. For each liability class, penetrance values were taken from the 2003 study of Antoniou et al., 30 by collapsing the incidence rates across the broader categories used in that study. These pedigrees were then analyzed using a modification of the LINKAGE package,31 as described by Thompson et al.,4 to obtain the required LR.Because the analysis of cosegregation relies on the distribution of the additional genotype data in the pedigree, conditional on the pedigree (including the proband) phenotypes, it is statistically independent from the family/personal information. Similarly, the co-occurrence data is independent from the other two sources, since individuals who also have known deleterious mutations are not considered in these analyses. Thus, the three individual LRs can be multiplied to arrive at a combined LR.Evaluation of Heterogeneity by Variant ClassTo estimate the proportion of mutations in the data set that are likely to be clinically significant as a function of location, conservation, class, etc., we performed a heterogeneity analysis analogous to that routinely used in linkage analysis. Specifically, the required likelihood is given byView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThis likelihood (in practice, the log likelihood) is then maximized over \\u03b1, and 95% CIs were constructed by finding those values of 2ln(likelihood) that differed by <3.84 from the maximum value. Hypotheses regarding differences in values of \\u03b1 as a function of partitions of the total variant space are performed using likelihood-ratio tests.The 1,433 variants were subdivided into the following groups:1.\\u2002Variants that changed the resulting protein\\u2014for example, MVs and IFDIs;2.\\u2002Variants that were extremely likely, on the basis of studies of many genes and experimental data, to affect splicing, defined for our purposes as (a) all IVS\\u00b1\\u00bd or (b) if the last nucleotide of the exon is G and if the first five bases of the subsequent intron are not GTRAG. Note that the latter set includes some missense mutations as well as silent substitutions; mutations that were missense changes as well as splice variants were counted only in the splice variant group.3.\\u2002Other variants, consisting primarily of intronic variants not located within 2 bp of the intron/exon splice junction, exonic variants likely to affect splicing but not meeting the strict definition above, and also a small number of variants in the 5\\u2032 UTRs and truncating variants at the extreme 3\\u2032 end of the genes.For the missense/IFDI category, we further subdivided the variants by their location within one of two recognized functional domains of the proteins: the C-terminus region containing the BRCA1 BRCT repeats, defined loosely here as \\u201camino acids 1396\\u20131862,\\u201d and the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 2500\\u20133098). We also categorized these variants according to whether the wild-type residue involved in the substitution/deletion was evolutionarily conserved through the pufferfish Tetraodon, using multiple-sequence alignments constructed by S.V.T. 10 and available on the Align GVGD Web site. In the case of three inframe insertions, these were denoted as \\u201cconserved\\u201d if the alignment across species was stable in the region surrounding the location of the insertion.Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 9.0 (StataCorp). The heterogeneity analysis was performed using the R programming language.ResultsWe first built the logistic-regression model comparing probands found with wild-type BRCA sequence with those with known deleterious mutations, using the factors detailed in the \\u201c Methods\\u201d section. As might be expected with the very large sample sizes used in the analysis, the logistic regressions were highly significant with good predictive power; areas under the ROC curve were \\u223c0.80 for BRCA1 and \\u223c0.70 for BRCA2. Not surprisingly, the most highly significant predictive factors associated with a deleterious BRCA1 mutation were associated with personal and family history of ovarian cancer, with high ORs for early-onset BRCA as well. For BRCA2, the most important factors were a personal history of male BRCA and personal/family history of early-onset BRCA. Interestingly a strong family history of BRCA diagnosed after age 50 years was associated with an increased probability of having a BRCA2 mutation but a decreased risk of carrying a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. For both genes, there were strong dose-response effects for decreasing age at onset of BRCA (or ovarian cancer) and also for increasing numbers of affected relatives. The details of the parameter estimates are provided in table 2 for the large European sample set; those for the other two ethnic classifications were broadly similar. The ethnicity- and gene-specific logistic-regression equations were then applied to a total of 3,951 family and personal histories of tested probands found to carry a VUS, to obtain log-ORs as described in the \\u201cMethods\\u201d section. The average number of such scores per variant was 2.76, with a range of 1\\u201377; over half of the studied variants had only a single family history available for study. One hundred eighty-two distinct variants had 5 or more family-history scores; of these, 72 had at least 10 family-history scores. The associated log-odds of causality per variant ranged from \\u221210.6 to 11.2, with a mean of \\u22120.26. Sixteen variants had total family history log10-likelihood\\u2013ratio (LLR) scores >2, whereas 55 VUSs had scores <\\u22122, indicating odds of 100:1 for and against the variant being deleterious, respectively, on the basis of the family-history analysis alone.In total, 351 pedigrees of probands with 127 (45 BRCA1; 82 BRCA2) distinct variants were analyzed for cosegregation with disease in families. Odds based on the pedigree data alone ranged from 138:1 in favor of causality based on six pedigrees to >250,000:1 against causality based on analysis of 17 pedigrees. It should be noted that the variants targeted for this analysis were selected on the basis of prior evidence that such analysis could contribute to the likelihood calculation. In the co-occurrence analysis, 121 variants were observed at least once in trans with a known deleterious mutation, and 21 were observed two or more times. The LLRs for this source of information ranged from <\\u22128 (for the variant BRCA1*N723D seen 82 times, of which 4 were in trans with a deleterious mutation) to 1.1 (BRCA1*A1708E, seen 76 times, never with a deleterious mutation). The combined evidence from all three sources ranged from odds of >1011:1 in favor of disease causality to 1012:1 against causality.Figure 1 contains the frequency distribution by gene of the combined log-odds of causality for the 1,433 VUSs. From this figure, we see that, whereas 133 variants could be classified as neutral with odds of >100:1, only 24 variants (18 BRCA1; 6 BRCA2) achieved this level of classification in favor of causality. The vast majority of variants analyzed are relatively uninformative and do not individually provide information ( fig. 1). Figure 2 displays the distribution of the log-odds of causality for missense and IFDIs as a function of whether they are located in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 or the DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. Although 27 of the 30 variants with odds in favor of causality >10:1 are in one of these two domains, it should be noted that 29 variants within these domains have odds in favor of neutrality of >100:1.Frequency histogram of combined LLR for 1,433 sequence VUSs, by gene (BRCA1 or ...Figure 1.

Table 4 lists the odds for the 133 variants that have odds of >100:1 against causality and thus are likely to be of no or little clinical significance on the basis of our observations. For those variants with both family history and cosegregation information, there was a modest but significant correlation between the log-odds scores for these two sources (r=0.32; P<.001).Table

However, there was significant heterogeneity among the three classes of sequence variant (missense/IFDI, splice, and other) (\\u03c72 2 df=109.7; P<.0001); 100% of splice-site mutations were estimated to be deleterious, compared with 12% of missense/IFDI mutations and 26% of other unclassified sequence variants. As in the overall set, no significant differences in the fraction of MVs estimated to be deleterious were observed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. A strong association with the position of the mutation was observed with 35% (95% CI 26%\\u201345%) of mutations within BRCT or DBD domains estimated to be deleterious, compared with 0% of mutations outside these domains (\\u03c72 1 df=56.3; P<.0001). There was no significant difference in the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (33%) and the BRCA1 BRCT domain (37%). When mutations were classified by conservation among species, 46% (95% CI 32%\\u201360%) of the conserved variants were classified as deleterious, compared with 3% of the nonconserved substitutions (\\u03c72 1 df=59.7; P<.0001). However, here, we did observe marginally statistically significant evidence that a higher proportion of BRCA1 missense substitutions occurring at strongly conserved positions were deleterious compared with those of BRCA2 (64% vs. 35%; P=.013).DiscussionUsing an approach based on three conditionally independent sources of information contained in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories large BRCA testing data set, we evaluated 1,433 sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Through this analysis, we were able to classify 93 variants with a threshold of odds of 1,000:1, 157 at 100:1, and 222 with odds of at least 20:1. In each case, the majority (e.g., 133 of 157 for 100:1 threshold) of VUSs classified were found to be of no clinical significance with respect to cancer risk. Although additional BRCA testing data produced by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, as well as similar data potentially available from other testing laboratories, primarily in Europe, could classify additional variants with use of this approach, it is clear that the majority of variants are unlikely to be classified in this manner, which highlights the need for use of other data. However, it should be noted that, because the variants most likely to be classified using our approach are generally the ones with many observations, the number of families who could benefit from our results is relatively large. On the basis of the Myriad database alone and with the assumption of a threshold for causality of 1,000:1 and for neutrality of 100:1, as proposed in Goldgar et al., 3 1,569 probands and their families may now have a more informative test result. Although only 140 of these are associated with a variant classified as a deleterious mutation that can be used in genetics counseling of their families, there is some benefit for the rest in knowing that they are unlikely to carry a clinically significant mutation and that their risk is that conferred by their family history alone.We emphasize that all the methods used in this article are based on the assumption that these variants are either neutral with respect to cancer risks or that they have the same age- and site-specific risks as the average BRCA mutation as estimated by Antoniou et al. 30 If a particular variant were associated with lower penetrance (but still elevated over noncarrier rates), it might provide inconclusive evidence, even given a large amount of available data, and/or there would be conflicts between the different sources of evidence (as well as other such as functional or in silico studies).Although most of the information for classification in this study is derived from the family-history analysis, in several instances, the three sources were needed to achieve a clinically useful threshold. For example, the BRCA1 variant I1766S (see table 3) shows odds in favor of causality of 13:1 from analysis of five family histories, 7.4:1 from cosegregation analysis of a single pedigree, and 1.44:1 on the basis of its observation seven times, never with a deleterious mutation, yielding overall odds of 139:1 in favor of this variant being deleterious compared with neutral. In contrast, the intronic variant BRCA1*IVS19-12G\\u2192A shows convincing odds based on six family histories (>30,000:1), but this conflicts with the pedigree cosegregation data (odds of 115:1 against, on the basis of three pedigrees); the overall combined evidence for this variant is 363:1, similar to that for I1766S. The reasons for this anomaly are unclear. It might reflect an unusual structure of families from the population from which this variant derives, or it might reflect some unusual pattern of risks associated with the mutation that are not well handled by these methods. To resolve this discrepancy, it would be helpful to verify the pedigree data and cancer diagnoses from the original provider/genetics counselor. Additionally, although there are no data from sequence homology to help in this analysis, in vitro tests of splicing might also provide data on the pathogenicity of this variant. Of the different approaches, we regard the cosegregation analysis as the most robust, since it relates directly to the disease risk and requires few assumptions. Unfortunately, relatively few variants can be classified by this approach alone. Our results demonstrate that the family-history classification can be very powerful, but it is more susceptible to bias due to population-specific ascertainment, 8 although this bias may be minimized by appropriate stratification into subgroups with different mutation prevalences. This highlights the need for some caution in the use of these predictions, especially when there are discrepancies between the methods.Of the 1,433 variants examined, the overall estimate of the proportion of those that are deleterious was 20%, indicating that perhaps as many as 286 of these variants could be deleterious mutations. As expected, there was good evidence that variants predicted to disrupt consensus splice donors were, as a group, deleterious; in fact, the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations was 1.0, so that there was no evidence of neutral variants under the selection criteria we used. This group accounted for an estimated 30% of all deleterious variants examined in the series. Among variants that resulted in a predicted altered BRCA protein, it was estimated that 12% were deleterious, and our analyses indicated that most (if not all) deleterious variants in this group fall at strongly conserved residues and/or in the recognized domains encompassing the BRCT repeats in BRCA1 and the DNA-binding domain in BRCA2. Note that mutations in the ring-finger domain of BRCA1 have been classified elsewhere as deleterious and thus are not included in this analysis. As a group, almost half of all missense substitutions (and IFDIs) falling at positions that were invariant in our alignments of vertebrate BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences were estimated to be deleterious; these variants, representing 218 of the 1,433 variants studied, would require odds of causality of 117:1 to have a posterior probability of 0.99 of being deleterious. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that VUSs in nonconserved residues or variants in other parts of the proteins are deleterious, the upper confidence limits for these groups indicate that it is unlikely that there are very many of these, and substantial evidence would be required to achieve a posterior probability of 0.99 for these variants. Although there was some slight evidence that the group of missense substitutions falling at variable residues includes deleterious substitutions, these were typically cases where the cross-species sequence variation was conservative and the substitution falls well outside the evolutionarily tolerated range of variation. Further, if only the 129 variants falling at invariant positions within the two important domains are considered, the proportion of variants that are estimated to be deleterious rises to 0.73 (0.58\\u20130.86). Among the 177 variants that were located in introns but not at consensus splice sites, in potential exonic splice sites, in the 5\\u2032 UTR, or at the extreme 3\\u2032 ends of the coding sequence, there was some evidence that this group may harbor deleterious variants (estimated proportion 26%), with 9 variants having odds in favor of causality of >10:1.For the variants in this analysis, the estimated proportions in table 5 could be used as prior probabilities to estimate posterior probabilities that each variant is deleterious. On the assumption that a posterior probability of 90% would be required to classify a mutation as \\u201cprobably deleterious,\\u201d missense substitutions (prior probability 0.12) require odds of 66:1 in favor of causality to be classified. Ten variants in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2 could be classified on this basis. The data on species conservation provide a more precise classification, however. On the basis of that data, mutations at invariant residues would require only odds of \\u223c10:1 to be classified as deleterious\\u201412 variants in BRCA1 and 11 in BRCA2 reach this level. In contrast, mutations at variable residues would require odds of \\u223c300:1, none of which do so.Although relatively few variants can currently be classified, these data can be combined with data from other sources to provide more-powerful discrimination. These data could include further pedigree cosegregation data, but also data on tumor histopathology, which is highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status, 32 and data on loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci. 33 ;  34 This approach has recently been used for classification of a small number of BRCA1/2 variants. 35; 36 ;  37The association with sequence conservation and mutation position that we have observed will also be useful for classification of new variants not present in this data set. Thus, these data indicate that a novel mutation identified in a high-risk family will have a substantial probability of being deleterious only if it occurs in a conserved domain. Note, however, that the \\u201cprior\\u201d probabilities given in table 5 refer strictly to the families and variants ascertained in this database, and their application outside this context should be undertaken with a degree of caution.Although many investigators have developed in silico approaches for classification and have used evaluation of sequence changes and some have applied functional data, all of these methods require external validation, and all have suffered from a lack of such validation. The data we generated here could serve as a useful source of validation of such approaches, through repeated sampling of each variant as neutral or deleterious on the basis of its posterior probability of causality and then use of the data to estimate parameters of sensitivity and specificity of other assays.What is the immediate clinical utility of the results from the present analyses? Clearly, variants with odds against causality of >1,000:1 (or even 100:1) could be considered neutral, rare polymorphisms for the purpose of genetics counseling, and the at-risk unaffected family members who carry such variants would be reassured that they are not at high risk of BRCA or ovarian cancer due to BRCA1 or BRCA2, although they could still be at increased risk on the basis of their family history alone. Those who carry 1 of the 10 variants for which the evidence achieves the threshold of 1,000:1, or perhaps the 48 (36 of which are at splice sites) with posterior probabilities >0.99, should logically be offered the same options as carriers of BRCA-truncating mutations. Apart from those variants that meet these thresholds, will it be useful to report intermediate categories of risk, such as \\u201clikely deleterious\\u201d or \\u201cprobably neutral,\\u201d or should the current odds in favor of or against causality be reported to the provider? These questions will require consideration by specialists in risk communication and other disciplines and, as such, are beyond the scope of this study. Our goal in this effort is to eventually classify, with such information, a large number of variants as either \\u201cdeleterious\\u201d or \\u201cneutral\\u201d and to incorporate the evidence behind the classification as part of the BIC database, as a centralized resource for clinicians and researchers alike. We feel that, with a systematic approach such as this, the problems of clinical interpretation and patient recommendations caused by these heretofore \\u201cuncertain\\u201d variants can be minimized.\",\n          \"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a cancer of skeletal muscle lineage, is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children [1]. Major subtypes of RMS include alveolar (ARMS) and embryonal (ERMS).[2, 3] Whereas ARMS typically contain translocations generating the PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 aberrant transcription factors which block terminal myogenic differentiation [4-6], no functionally comparable genetic event has been found in ERMS. Here, we report the discovery, through whole exome sequencing, of a recurrent somatic point mutation Leu122Arg in the myogenic transcription factor, MYOD1, in a distinctive subset of ERMS with poor outcomes that also often contain PI3K/AKT pathway mutations. Previous mutagenesis studies had shown that MYOD1 Leu122Arg can block wild-type MYOD1 function and bind to MYC consensus sequences [7], suggesting a possible switch from differentiation to proliferation. Our functional data now confirm this prediction. RMS with MYOD1 Leu122Arg represents a molecularly defined subset of RMS eligible for high risk protocols and targeted therapeutic development.  We performed whole exome sequencing on 20 RMS samples (9 ARMS, 11 ERMS) of which 8 (2 ARMS, 6 ERMS) also underwent whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS). The patient ages at diagnosis for the ARMS and ERMS tumor samples ranged from 1-25 and 1-21 years, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). Complete tables of variant calls are provided in the Supplement (Supplementary Table 3). In addition to mutations in RAS genes and FGFR4 seen in ERMS samples and previously reported in this RMS subtype [8, 9], two ERMS showed the same c.365T>G point mutation in MYOD1, leading to an Leu122Arg substitution (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). Both were primary tumor samples and, in each case, normal tissue did not harbor the variant, confirming these as somatic mutations. WTS data were available for one of the two samples with the MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutation and this showed that the mutant allele was highly expressed (Supplementary Figure 1). MYOD1, as a member of the bHLH family of transcription factors,[10] binds DNA through the basic domain adjacent to its HLH dimerization domain. The Leu122Arg mutation occurs in the conserved basic region of MYOD1, at a highly specific conserved residue that is a leucine in all myogenic bHLH transcription factors, including MYOD1, MYF5, MYOG (myogenin) and MRF4, but is an arginine in MYC-family bHLH transcription factors, including MYC and MYCN (Figure 1). Remarkably, the MYOD1 Leu122Arg was created experimentally over 20 years ago by Van Antwerp and colleagues who examined whether mutating the MYOD1 basic domain to render it more similar to the MYC basic domain would confer it with oncogenic properties.[7] They showed that the MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutant bound a consensus MYOD1 site, competing with wild-type MYOD1, but without leading to MYOD1 target gene transactivation, as well as a MYC consensus sequence, thereby potentially deregulating MYC target genes. They hypothesized that this apparent combination of inhibition of differentiation (lack of MYOD1 transactivation) and enhanced proliferation (MYC-like properties) could be a key oncogenic feature of RMS.[7]  Figure 1 Figure 1 Identification of MYOD1 Leu122Arg in RMS To better assess the prevalence of this mutation in ERMS, we genotyped another 93 ERMS for MYOD1 Leu122Arg using mass spectrometry-based genotyping (Sequenom). The mutation was detected in 8 additional cases (and confirmed as somatic in 6 cases with available normal DNA), resulting in an overall prevalence of approximately 10% (10/104) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2). No MYOD1 mutations were found in 25 ARMS (19 fusion positive, 6 fusion negative). To exclude the possibility of analogous leucine to arginine mutations in other highly related myogenic factors (MYF5 L96R, MYF6 L106R, MYOG L94R), we screened 101 ERMS (from the above set of 104) for such mutations but none were identified (Figure 1).  The ERMS harboring the MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutation displayed high cellularity and frequent spindle cell morphology with strong positivity for MYOD1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 2), suggesting, in some cases, a pathologic overlap with the adult spindle cell variant of ERMS [11, 12]. Notably, 9 of 10 ERMS with MYOD1 mutations were from patients diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood (mean age = 25; median age = 28), were more likely to arise in the head/neck (8/10 vs 16/80; p=0.0003), and were somewhat more common in females (8/45 vs 2/53; p=0.04). Furthermore, the survival of patients with MYOD1-mutant ERMS was significantly poorer than for ERMS lacking MYOD1 mutation (0% vs 48% at 10 yrs; p=0.02) (Figure 2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Distinctive clinicopathologic features and outcome of ERMS with MYOD1 Leu122Arg Previous functional studies on the MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutant had documented effects on binding and regulation of model MYOD1 and MYC targets.[7] To extend these data, we first sought to evaluate the effect of the MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutant on myogenic differentiation. We therefore examined morphological differences during induced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in growth factor-deficient medium following retroviral introduction of wild type MYOD1, MYOD1 Leu122Arg, and MYC (Figure 3a). Increased differentiation index and enhanced muscle cell fusion were observed in MYOD1-expressing C2C12 cells (Figure 3b). In contrast, these were not observed in C2C12 cells expressing MYOD1 Leu122Arg (Figure 3b). Consistent with previous data [13], C2C12 cells expressing MYC could be induced to undergo limited differentiation but cell fusion was severely inhibited (Figure 3b). Wild type MYOD1 induced reduced growth of C2C12 cells while MYOD1 Leu122Arg did not affect in vitro growth (Figure 3c). In soft-agar colony formation assay, MYOD1 Leu122Arg increased the number of transformed colonies although colony size was smaller than that seen in C2C12 cells with MYC (Figure 3a and 3d). In comparison, the same experiments performed in normal growth medium produced myogenic differentiation only in C2C12 cells expressing wild type MYOD1 (See Supplementary Note; Supplementary Figure 3).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Effects of MYOD1 Leu122Arg on cell growth and myogenic differentiation in vitro In a previous report, we identified PIK3CA mutations in 3 of 60 ERMS [8]. Remarkably, all 3 of these PIK3CA-mutated tumor samples are among the 10 MYOD1 Leu122Arg cases identified here (Table 1). The relationship between MYOD1 Leu122Arg and PIK3CA mutations appeared significant in the 66 cases with genotyping data for both (PIK3CA mutations in 3/10 MYOD1 Leu122Arg cases vs 0/56 MYOD1 wild type cases; Fisher\\u2019s exact p=0.003). The notion that MYOD1 Leu122Arg is associated with mutations activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is further strengthened by the finding of 2 additional MYOD1-mutated ERMS with PTEN deletions (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 4). Therefore, to asses possible cooperation between these mutations, we examined the effects of PIK3CA H1047R and MYOD1 Leu122Arg in C2C12 cells. We introduced GFP, wild type MYOD1, MYOD1 Leu122Arg and MYC, each combined with PIK3CA H1047R, into C2C12 cells and compared these to C2C12 cells transfected with GFP and control vector (Figure 4a). Although introduction of PIK3CA H1047R by itself decreased the differentiation index and fusion index, this effect was not observed in combination with wild type MYOD1. However, in combination with MYOD1 Leu122Arg, differentiation was markedly inhibited (Figure 4b). While PIK3CA H1047R increased the growth of C2C12 cells regardless of MYOD1, soft-agar colony formation assays showed that only the combination of PIK3CA H1047R and MYOD1 Leu122Arg resulted in increased colony formation; notably, combining wild type MYOD1 with PIK3CA H1047R did not cause a similar increase (Figure 4c and 4d). The negative effect of wild type MYOD1 on C2C12 cell number and colony formation in the presence of normal medium appears to be due to induction of differentiation accompanied by cell fusion (Supplementary Fig. 3a). However, co-transfection of PIK3CA H1047R with wild type MYOD1 inhibited myogenic differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 3c). We further confirmed the combined effects of PIK3CA H1047R and MYOD1 Leu122Arg in C2C12 cells in vivo using cell line xenografts. While introduction of either MYOD1 Leu122Arg or PIK3CA H1047R increased in vivo growth of C2C12 cells, the combination of PIK3CA H1047R and MYOD1 Leu122Arg resulted in more rapidly growing tumors (Figure 4e). These double mutant xenograft tumors share characteristic features of ERMS such as strong nuclear MYOD1 expression, abundant mitotic activity, and high-grade nuclear atypia (Figure 4f).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Effects of concurrent PIK3CA H1047R on MYOD1 Leu122Arg-induced phenotypes in vitro and in vivo Table 1 Table 1 Table of clinicopathologic data on 10 patients with ERMS containing MYOD1 Leu122Arg As MYOD1 Leu122Arg is likely to function as an aberrant transcription factor, we examined associated gene expression changes. In C2C12 mouse cells, overlaps among both upregulated and downregulated genes were greater between MYOD1 Leu122Arg and MYC than between the former and wild type MYOD1 (p<0.001 for both upregulated and downregulated genes) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In BJ human fibroblast cells, the overlap among downregulated genes was greater between MYOD1 Leu122Arg and MYC than between the former and wild type MYOD1 (p<0.001) but the overlap of upregulated genes was not significantly different (p=0.425) (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering placed C2C12 cells with MYOD1 Leu122Arg into an independent cluster separate from MYC and wild type MYOD1, while, in BJ cells, MYOD1 Leu122Arg-bearing cells and MYC-bearing cells together formed a cluster separate from wild type MYOD1 cells and parental BJ cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c and 5d). Analysis of muscle differentiation genes within the MYOD1 Leu122Arg expression profiles in C2C12 and BJ cells (see Supplementary Note; Supplementary Table 4 and 5), showed that terminal myogenic genes were up-regulated by wild type MYOD1 and down-regulated by MYOD1 Leu122Arg (Figure 5), consistent with a differentiation block induced by this mutation.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Aberrant transcriptional effects of MYOD1 Leu122Arg As an alternative approach to examine these gene expression relationships, we also used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[14] on the gene list from MYOD1 Leu122Arg transfected C2C12 cells using the pre-ranked GSEA function and the transcription factor targets gene sets within the C3: Motif Collection from the Molecular Signature Database [14]. A MYC target gene set was among six gene sets that were significantly enriched in the MYOD1 Leu122Arg transfected C2C12 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Taken together, these results are consistent with previous data from electrophoretic mobility shift assays and model promoter transactivation asssays showing that the Leu122Arg mutation confers upon this mutant MYOD1 the neomorphic capacity to bind and regulate MYC target sites [7].  These observations raised the possibility of a dominant negative effect of MYOD1 Leu122Arg. Although loss of heterozygosity at 11p15 is frequent in ERMS (refs 15 & 16), our data from Affymetrix Oncoscan LOH analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4) and comparisons of mutant and wild type alleles in genotyping data (Supplementary Fig. 2) together supported loss of the wild type allele in only 5 of the 10 MYOD1 Leu122Arg tumors. This suggested that loss of the wild type MYOD1 allele was not required. Therefore, to assess a dominant negative effect of the MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutant, we compared the effect of transfecting the latter alone to that of co-transfecting it with equal amounts of wild type MYOD1 on three myogenic genes. Intriguingly, the expression levels of Myh1, Acta1 and Myog were reduced by 84%, 61% and 84%, respectively, in the co-transfected C2C12 cells compared to cells transfected with wild type MYOD1 alone (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that even in the presence of wild type MYOD1, MYOD1 Leu122Arg can inhibit the expression of myogenic target genes to a supralinear degree, implying a dominant effect.  MYOD1 is known to recruit histone-modifying enzymes that increase the levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac to promote muscle differentiation [15]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in C2C12 cells at three myotube-specific genes [16] Mly1, Myl2, and Casq2 showed that H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 marks were increased in the presence of MYOD1 Leu122Arg but not wild type MYOD1 (see Supplementary Note; Supplementary Fig. 8). To extend these ChIP data, we performed ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone marks in C2C12 cells transfected with mutant or wild type MYOD1. Consistent with the above data from individual ChIP assays, forced expression of MYOD1 Leu122Arg, but not wild type MYOD1, resulted in the emergence of peaks for these marks that were significantly enriched for the 99 differentially regulated genes described above (see Supplementary Note for details; Supplementary Table 6). Finally, to look for genome-wide evidence of a shift induced by MYOD1 Leu122Arg towards a MYC transcriptional program, we analyzed the ChIP-seq data for the activation mark H3K4me3, comparing ChIP-seq peaks to those previously defined for MYC [17]. This analysis demonstrated that, while both mutant and wild type MYOD1 are associated with deposition of H3K4me3 marks at MYC targets, this effect is highly significantly stronger for MYOD1 Leu122Arg (p<10E-15; Supplementary Table 7). These ChIP-seq data for H3K4me3 are therefore in line with the above expression profiling data showing a shift to a MYC-like transcriptional program.  Previously described genetic alterations in ERMS include LOH at 11p15 [18, 19] and activating mutations of RAS, FGFR4, and PIK3CA [8, 9, 20] but none of these define clinically distinct ERMS subsets. In contrast, ERMS tumors with MYOD1 Leu122Arg are distinctive, as they tend to present in older patients, usually arise in the head/neck, some overlap pathologically with the recently described spindle cell variant of ERMS, and have especially poor outcomes. Indeed, the poor outcomes of these patients are more similar to ARMS than to ERMS. Another parallel with ARMS is the observation that transfection of PAX-FOXO1 fusions into myoblasts leads to suppression of MYOD1 targets [21], providing a mechanism for how PAX-FOXO1 fusions may lead to differentiation arrest, even as they upregulate expression of MYOD1 itself [22, 23]. As progression through the different myogenic stages is controlled by the sequential activation of four myogenic factors, namely MYOD1, MYF5, MYOG (myogenin) and MRF4, PAX-FOXO1 fusions and MYOD1 Leu122Arg may represent alternative mechanisms to disrupt this differentiation program at the MYOD1 stage.  As MYOD1 has long been recognized as a critical regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation [24], artificial mutations have been used to explore its function, leading to the in vitro identification, over 20 years ago, of the Leu122Arg mutation as a neomorphic change.[7] Following up on that in vitro finding, the same group [25] screened for MYOD1 Leu122Arg in human RMS samples, including 19 primary RMS tumors and 14 cell lines, but no mutations were identified. Possible reasons that MYOD1 mutations were not identified in that study include a limited number of actual ERMS tested (about 20), misidentification of certain cell lines as RMS, and fewer tumor samples from patients diagnosed in late childhood or adulthood.  Although PIK3CA mutations are uncommon in ERMS (approximately 5% of cases) [8], we find that they are significantly over-represented in the subset of ERMS with MYOD1 Leu122Arg. We also observed PTEN intragenic deletions in additional cases. Together with our findings in C2C12 cells expressing MYOD1 Leu122Arg and PIK3CA H1047R, these observations suggest cooperation between a transcriptional differentiation block and mutational activation of pro-survival PI3K/AKT signaling, as has recently been established for MYCN and ALK in another major pediatric solid tumor, neuroblastoma.[26, 27] Overall, our data establish ERMS with MYOD1 Leu122Arg as a novel, molecularly defined subset of RMS that should be considered for high risk protocols and targeted therapeutic development.  Go to: METHODS Samples for Illumina Hiseq sequencing  Frozen tumor samples and matched frozen normal tissue samples were procured at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) under Institutional Review Board\\u2013approved protocols with informed consent. DNA was extracted from RMS cell lines and frozen samples using the Qiagen DNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer\\u2019s directions.  Exome capture and high throughput sequencing  Two \\u03bcg of high quality genomic DNA was captured by hybridization using the SureSelect XT HumanAllExon 51Mb (Agilent). Samples were prepared according to the manufacturer instructions. PCR amplification of the libraries was carried out for 6 cycles in the pre-capture step and for 10 cycles post capture. Samples were barcoded and run on a Hiseq 2000 in a 75bp/75bp paired end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina). An average of 81 million paired reads were generated per sample, the duplication rate varied between 5 and 11% and 94% of the targeted region was covered at least 30X.  Transcriptome sequencing  After ribogreen quantification and quality control of Agilent BioAnalyzer, 1\\u03bcg of total RNA (RIN between 5 and 7) underwent polyA selection and Truseq library preparation according to instructions provided by Illumina (TruSeq\\u2122 RNA Sample Prep Kit v2), with 6 cycles of PCR. Samples were barcoded and run on a Hiseq 2000 in a 75bp/75bp Paired end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina). An average of 80 million paired reads were generated per sample. Ribosomal reads represented at most 0.1% of reads and the percent of mRNA bases was close to 68% on average.  Illumina Hiseq Exome Variant Calling Pipeline  FASTQ files generated by the CASAVA bcl2fastq scripts were processed in the default block size of 4,000,000 reads per block. The reads were clipped of adapter sequences using fastx_clipper from the FASTX toolkit. The adapters specific to the R1 and R2 reads were used and any reads shorter than 50bp after clipping were discarded. Reads were then trimmed using the fastq_quality_trimmer to cut bases with a base quality less than 3 and again reads shorter than 50bp were dropped. Using a custom Perl script, we repaired reads and any read whose pair was discard in the clipping/trimming phase was moved to a file of single end reads to be processed separately.  All reads were then mapped to a genome comprising just the assembled chromosomes (chr1-chr22, chrX, chrY, chrM) of build hg19 of the human genome. BWA version 0.5.9-r16 was used. bwa aln was used for both paired and single end reads. Then SAM files were created using bwa sampe for paired reads and bwa samse for single end reads. Read Groups were added at this point and the SAM files were filtered for proper pairing and unique maps (MAPQ>0). The blocks were sorted and then merged using PICARD MergeSamFiles and duplicates were removed using PICARD MarkDuplicates.  Next, the BAMs for all samples were processed following the GATK best practices guidelines. GATK version 1.6-7 was used. First, the BAMs were realigned using GATK RealignerTargetCreator followed by GATK IndelRealigner. These steps were done on all samples with each chromosome processed in parallel. Then the quality scores were recalibrated. GATK CountCovariates was run using the following covariates: ReadGroupCovariate, QualityScoreCovariate, CycleCovariate, DinucCovariate, MappingQualityCovariate, MinimumNQSCovariate. The recalibrated BAMs were then computed with GATK TableRecalibration. To call variants, we used the GATK Unified Genotyper separately for SNPs and INDELs. The following options were used. For SNP calling: -stand_call_conf 50.0, -stand_emit_conf 10.0, -dcov 500, -mbq 15; and for INDEL calling: -stand_call_conf 50.0, -stand_emit_conf 10.0, -dcov 500, -mbq 15.  To filter for somatic events, we used a custom Python script that discards events flagged by GATK as LowQual then we filtered for events that were genotyped 0/0 in the normal sample and not 0/0 in the tumor sample (i.e. 0/1 or 1/1). We also filtered for a minimum coverage of 2 reads with a given variant (i.e. AD_ALT>1) in the tumor and a minimum coverage of 2 reads that matched the reference (AD_REF>1) in the normal. We also filtered on the non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) such that NRAF_TUMOR>NRAF_NORMAL+0.10; i.e. is the tumor had to have an NRAF 10 percentage points higher than the normal. Finally, we retained only events that either changed the amino acid sequence (missense or nonsense, or any indel targeting an exon) or events that occurred at splice sites.  For the unpaired tumor samples (lacking matched normals), we used the following two subtraction filters. First, we removed events that were called in either of the two normal samples and, second, we removed any events from a curated version of dbSNP 135. The curation consisted in removing any SNPs from dbSNP that were annotated as having clinical significance, specifically any SNP that had an OM, CLN, PMC, or PM tag in its VCF entry.  Illumina Hiseq RNAseq Variant Calling Pipeline  To call variants in RNAseq data, we used a custom pipeline based on TopHat and VarScan. The sequence data were mapped using TopHat (v 1.4.0) with the transcriptome mapping option on, using the RefSeq gene GTF from UCSC with genes smaller than 150 bp removed. The BAM files from TopHat were processed to make them compatible with VarScan. This consisted of reordering the chromosome header information to match the correct genome order, marking reads with read groups and coordinate sorting the file. We then used samtools mpileup with the depth parameter set to 1000 (-d 1000) and passed the pileup to VarScan (v 2.3.2) mpileup2snp. The previous exome calls were then intersected with the RNAseq calls creating a list of events that were present in both datasets. The combined calls were filtered to have a combined depth of at least 10 reads (DP_RNA+DP_EXOME>=10) and again filtered for events that changed the amino acid sequence. Finally, they were also filtered against the curated dbSNP 135 database described in the preceding section.  Validation samples and Sequenom-based DNA genotyping  Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ERMS samples were procured at MSKCC under Institutional Review Board\\u2013approved protocols. Additional FFPE ERMS samples were acquired at the Brigham and Women\\u2019s Hospital, Boston (JAF) (13 ERMS), at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven (RS) (9 ERMS), and at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (JB) (6 ERMS), under respective institutional protocols. In addition, 3 ERMS cell lines were included in the set: RD (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA), RMS559 (from J.A.F.), and the clonally related lines CT-TC (from Dr Hajime Hosoi) and SMS-CTR (from Fred Barr). These validation samples were studied using the MassARRAY system (Sequenom), which is based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization \\u2014time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Genotyping by this method relies on the principle that mutant and wild-type alleles for a given point mutation produce single-allele base extension reaction products of a mass that is specific to the sequence of the product. Mutation calls are based on the mass differences between the wild-type product and the mutant products as resolved by MALDI-TOF/MS. Amplification and extension primers were designed using Sequenom Assay Designer v3.1 software to target the curated list of mutations. Amplification primers were designed with a 10-mer tag sequence to increase their mass so that they fall outside the range of detection of the MALDI-TOF/MS. The sequences of the primers are shown in Supplementary Table 8.  Immunohistochemistry  IHC was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections using MYOD1 antibody (Thermo Scientific, MS-278-P) and a Ventana immunostainer Discovery XT. After pretreatment (CC1), primary antibody was applied (dilution 1:50) for 90 minutes. The iView Detection Kit (Ventana) was used for detection following the manufacturer\\u2019s recommendations.  Statistical analysis of survival data  Curves for overall survival (calculated as the time from diagnosis) were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using the log-rank test.  Cell lines  Mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (ATCC#CRL-1772) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT)-expressing BJ cells, human diploid foreskin fibroblasts was kindly provided by Dr. Shinya Tanaka (Hokkaido University, Japan). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\\u2019s modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA).  Immunofluorescence  Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and blocked in PBS containing 2% goat serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.05% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with the MF20 monoclonal antibody (MAb) against MHC (1:40; DSHB, Iowa City, IA, USA) for 2.5 h and subsequently with an Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-dole; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  Preparation of retrovirus and transduction of cell lines  For retrovirus production, the pcx4 [28]and pBabe vectors system were used. Human MYOD1 and MYC cDNA plasmids were purchased from Sino Biological Inc and subcloned into pcx4bleo. MYOD1 Leu122Arg mutant was generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA) and subcloned into pcx4bleo. pBabe-puro (Addgene plasmid 1764), pBabe puro HA PIK3CA H1047R (Addgene plasmid 12524) and pBabe puro HA PIK3CA E545K (Addgene plasmid 12525) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). Retroviruses were obtained by using 293T cells as packaging cells, and were infected into C2C12 and BJ cell lines and selected with 500 \\u03bcg/ml Zeocin or 2 \\u03bcg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  Immunoblotting  Cells were lysed in M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). The lysates were denatured in 4 \\u00d7 sample buffer at 70\\u00b0C for 10 min, resolved in 4\\u201312% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature and probed with primary antibody obtained from the following sources: anti-MYOD1 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA, Cat #MAB3878,); anti-GAPDH MAb (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA, Cat #GTX627408,); anti- CMYC polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA, USA, Cat #sc-40); anti-PI3 Kinase p110\\u03b1 MAb (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA, Cat #4249). Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-labeled goat antibody to mouse IgG or goat antibody to rabbit IgG, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).  Myogenic Differentiation Assays  To induce myoblast differentiation, cells were grown to 70% confluence and then cultured in differentiation media containing DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Differentiation media were replaced every 24 h. To quantify the differentiation and fusion phenotypes of C2C12 cells under different experimental conditions, we calculated differentiation index (DI) as: (nuclei within MHC-positive myocytes/total number of nuclei) \\u00d7 100; or the fusion index (FI) as: (nuclei within MHC-positive myocytes containing > 3 nuclei/ total number of nuclei) \\u00d7 100.  Soft-agar colony formation assay  Single-cell suspensions of 1\\u00d7104 cells were plated per 35-mm culture dish in 1.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.4%Bacto Agar (BD Difco, Detroit, MI, USA.) on a layer of 1.5 ml of the same medium containing 0.6% Bacto Agar. Plates were fed weekly with 0.3 ml of DMEM/10% FBS. Four weeks after plating, colonies were stained with Trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), photographed, and counted.  Xenograft tumor assay  For xenograft preparation, 10,000,000 cells were injected s.c. into randomly selected 8-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan) together with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The average tumor volume in each group was expressed in cubic millimeter and calculated using the formula \\u03c0 / 6 \\u00d7 (large diameter) \\u00d7 (small diameter)2. The tumors injections and volume measurements were performed in a blinded manner. All animal procedures were carried out according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.  Microarray analysis  For expression microarray analysis, RNAs were processed at MSKCC according to procedures recommended by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (HG-U133 Plus 2.0) is comprised of 1,300,000 unique oligonucleotide features covering over 47,000 transcripts and variants, which, in turn, represent approximately 39,000 of the best characterized human genes. The GeneChip\\u00ae Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array (Mouse 430A 2.0) is a single array comprised of over 22,600 probe sets representing over 14,500 well-substantiated mouse genes. Array hybridization and scanning were performed at the MSKCC Genomics Core Laboratory. The RMA method [29] was used to process the Affymetrix gene expression microarray data. Hierarchical clustering was used to cluster the arrays based on the expression profile of all genes on the array. Pearson correlation was used as the similarity/distance measure and the Ward function was used as the link function for the clustering. The array clustering is presented as dendrograms. Fold change greater than 2 is used to select genes that are differentially expressed between cell lines. The expression data of selected genes were displayed as heatmaps. The array analyses were done using the R software and the Bioconductor package [30]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [14] was performed on the gene list from MYOD1 Leu122Arg transfected C2C12 cells using the preranked GSEA function and the transcription factor target gene sets within the C3: Motif Collection from the Molecular Signature Database [14]. Genes were ranked according to their differential expression scores and GSEA was run with default settings.  Affymetrix Oncoscan Analysis  For the Oncoscan FFPE Assay, DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. 80ng of genomic DNA was used for each sample. Processing of samples was performed as per manufacturer (Affymetrix) guidelines. Assay data was analyzed by the combination of OncoScan Console Software and OncoScan Nexus Express Software.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation  ChIP was performed by using Magna ChIP\\u2122 A system (Millipore), and sonication was performed to obtain chromatin fragments of approximately 150 bp. Antibodies used for ChIP were rabbit IgG (Millipore), H3K27me3, H3K27Ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 (Abcam). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using a StepOne Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SYBR Green DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Data were normalized by the percent of input and expressed as fold increase relative to control. The sequences of primers are shown in Supplementary Table 8.  ChIP-Seq  ChIP fragments were sequenced for both 100 and 75 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq2500. The longer length runs were cut to 75 bp and then adapters were removed using the FASTX toolkit. Sequence alignment was performed using BWA [31] against the mouse genome assembly mm10. BWA version 0.7.5a was used and the ALN/SAMSE mode of the aligner was run. The output SAM files had readGroups added and sorted in coordinate order using the PICARD toolkit. Peaks were then called using MACS [32] version 1.4. For samples targeting histone binding factors the --nomodel option was used. For all samples MACS [32] was run in pairwise mode with a matched control sample. Differential binding analysis was performed using the DiffBind R Bioconductor package [33], using the TMM method for normalization and the edgeR method for differential analysis, employing the default settings and filtering with a mapping quality of at least 15. To define the overlap between identified peaks and 99 differentially expressed genes in the presence of ectopic expression of MYOD Leu122Arg or wild type MYOD1, for each sample, the unique genes closest to the summits of the peaks were identified and the intersection of the gene lists generated for each triplicate was used as a consensus set of unique genes. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using hypergeometric tests, using 34,060 as the total number of genes as defined as the number of genes with nucleotide sequence data by the Mouse Genome Informatics.  MyoD and c-Myc, members of the large \\\"basic-helix-loop-helix\\\" family of proteins, regulate diverse aspects of both normal and neoplastic growth and specific gene regulation. These two proteins differ at 9 of the 14 amino acids that comprise the basic domans necessary for DNA binding and tanscript control. Individual amino acids in the MyoD basic domain were mutated to those found at the analog positions in c-Myc. Four classes of mutants were obtained: (0 those with no effects on MyoD-site binding or activation of MyoD-responsive genes, (fi) those with no effect on MyoD-site bindin but with a loss of activation potential, (w) those with a loss of both DNA binding and activation potential, and (iv) one mutant (mut 9, Leu122 - Arg) that left MyoD-site binding unaffected but imparted a new c-Myc-site binding capability. mut 9 competed with wild-type protein for the activation of MyoD-responsive reporter genes but could, like c-Myc, also suppress the adenovirus major-late promoter, which contains a c-Myc binding site. Our studies thus identify specific amino acid residues in the MyoD basc domain that are important for its activity as a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. Most signiflcantiy, our results with mat 9 indicate that Leulm of MyoD is a critical determinant of specific DNA binding and that mutation at this residue can alter this specificity. The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of proteins consists of >20 members involved in myogenesis, proliferation, oncogenesis, and other aspects of tissue-specific gene expression (1-3). bHLH domains consist of a 12- to 15-amino acid segment containing a high content of basic residues and a region consisting of two amphipathic a-helices of \\\"15 amino acids each (1). The basic motif comprises a sequencespecific DNA-binding domain whereas the HLH region is required for dimerization (4, 5). DNA binding is greatly enhanced with dimerized proteins (4, 6, 7), although dimerization does not require the DNA-binding domain (4). bHLH proteins bind a consensus DNA element termed an E-box motif, whose precise sequence is determined by the amino acids comprising the basic domain (7, 8). Basic-domain mutations that allow for E-box binding but not for subsequent expression of an adjacent reporter gene indicate that DNA binding and transcriptional activation are distinct and separable functions of bHLH proteins (4, 9, 10). MyoD, in heterodimeric association with its companion protein E12 (or E47), binds specifically to E-box sites (CACCTG) located in the promoters of muscle-specific genes (8, 11-14). Myc proteins have been shown to dimerize with the bHLH-containing protein Max (15, 16) and to bind an E-box element of a sequence (CACGTG) different from that bound by MyoD (17-20). Myc and Max comprise a distinct subset of the bHLH family based upon two major criteria: (i) all members contain an additional leucine zipper domain that is also important for dimerization and in vivo activity (15, 16, 21, 22) and (ii) neither protein dimerizes with any other members of the bHLH family (1, 15, 23). MyoD and c-Myc differ at 9 of the 14 amino acids of their basic domains. We have altered individual or multiple amino acids in the MyoD basic domain to those found at the analogous positions in c-Myc and have thus identified four classes of mutations. Of greatest interest is a mutation that allows MyoD protein to bind to a c-Myc DNA site with high affinity and to regulate a gene containing a c-Myc site. Surprisingly, this mutant protein retains the ability to bind a MyoD site but can no longer trigger myogenesis or induce the expression of a MyoD-responsive gene. Naturally occurring MyoD mutations, such as those described here, might contribute to the genesis of skeletal muscle tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutagenesis and in Vitro Expression of MyoD eDNAs. A full-length murine MyoD cDNA in the vector pEMc11S (24) was excised with EcoRI and recloned in M13mpl8. Singlestranded phage DNA was used for mutagenesis (25) with a Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit and specific mutagenic oligonucleotides (Fig. 1). Mutant cDNAs were excised from doublestranded phage DNAs and cloned into either pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) or the pRcCMV eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, St. Louis). In vitro transcribed RNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with either [35S]methionine or nonradioactive methionine. In some cases, translation mixes included either E12 RNA [from the plasmid pE12R (1) (gift of D. Baltimore, Rockefeller University)] or chimeric Max/E12 RNA (see below). Radioactively labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. In some cases, proteins were immunoprecipitated with either a polyclonal anti-MyoD antibody (gift of S. Tapscott, University of Washington) or an anti-Max antibody generated with a bacterially expressed full-length Max protein (unpublished work). Cell Culture and DNA Transfection. C3H/10T/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% supplemented calf serum (HyClone). Transfections (4) included equivalent amounts of the f3-galactosidase-encoding plasmid pCH110 to correct for transfection efficiencies prior to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays. To study myogenesis, transfected cells were incubated in DMEM plus 2% heat-inactivated horse serum for 4 days. Colonies were fixed (24) and incubated with the anti-myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibody MF-20 (26).

MyoD mutations. Upper line shows the 14 amino acids comprising the murine MyoD basic domain [amino acids 109-122 of the published sequence (24)], which, for convenience in the text, are arbitrarily denoted as 1-14. Lower line shows the amino acid sequence of the murine c-Myc basic domain (amino acids 354-367). The two sequences are aligned for maximal homology with differences indicated by numbers. By using mutagenic oligonucleotides, the indicated amino acids in the MyoD basic region were changed to those found in the analogous position in c-Myc (numbers with arrows). Staining was performed with the alkaline phosphatase-based Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). CAT vectors included p3300MCKCAT, which contains the MyoD-responsive murine muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (11), and pMLP-CAT, which contains the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) abutted to a CAT gene (gift from L. Resar and C. V. Dang, Johns Hopkins University). Chimeric Max/E12 cDNA. Specific oligonucleotide primers were used in a standard PCR to generate a chimeric cDNA encoding the Max basic domain (codons 1-36; ref. 15) and the E12 HLH domain (codons 349-440; ref. 1). For expression in cultured cells, the 400-base-pair chimeric cDNA was excised from its parental Bluescript vector and blunt-end ligated into pRc/CMV. Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assays (EMSAs). A 25- nucleotide 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing a highaffinity MyoD binding site (4) was annealed with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled complementary-strand DNA for DNAbinding assays. For a c-Myc site, we used the 26-nucleotide palindromic EO(GAC) oligonucleotide (19). The end-labeled oligonucleotide was allowed to self-anneal before use in EMSAs. Binding reaction mixtures, containing 10 Al of unlabeled reticulocyte lysate and 10 ,l of2 x binding buffer [40 mM Hepes, pH 7.6/100 mM KCl/2 mM dithiothreitol/2 mM EDTA with 2 ,g of poly(dI-dC)/1.0 ng of double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (-106 dpm), and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol], were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, immediately loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide/N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio), and electrophoresed in 45 mMTris/45 mMboric acid/2 mM EDTA for -2.5 hr at 8 V/cm. Gels were then dried and autoradiographed at -70\\u00b0C for 4-16 hr using a single intensifying screen. RESULTS Mutagenesis of the MyoD Basic Region. We used oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis of full-length MyoD cDNA to change one or more amino acids in the MyoD basic domain to those found at analogous positions in c-Myc (Fig. 1). Six mutations encoded single amino acid changes (designated mut 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9; Fig. 1), one encoded a double mutation [mut (7 +9)], and one encoded a quadruple mutation [mut (1-4)]. Each mutant was transcribed in vitro, translated in the presence of E12 mRNA, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-MyoD antibody. The precipitates were subjected to SDS/PAGE and autoradiography. Dimerization between E12 and each MyoD protein was readily detected (Fig. 2B). These experiments demonstrate that all eight mutants were translated equivalently and dimerized equally well with E12. Binding of MyoD Mutants to a MyoD Recognition Site. Each MyoD mutant was next tested for its DNA-binding ability. Unlabeled in vitro translated proteins were incubated with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing a MyoD binding site (4) and subjected to EMSA. Very weak DNA binding was obtained with individual E12 and MyoD proteins, whereas the combination of the two proteins allowed for readily detectable DNA binding (Fig. 2C) (4, 12). Most of the MyoD mutants retained the ability to bind a MyoD site. However, mut 7 and, to a lesser extent, mut (7+9), showed a greatly reduced capacity for binding. The specificity of binding was tested in two ways. First, the addition of anti-MyoD antibody to the lysate prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide abolished binding whereas a control antibody was without effect (Fig. 2D). Second, formation of the radioactive complex was blocked by the addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide but not by the addition of an equivalent amount of an oligonucleotide containing a mutant MyoD binding site (4) (Fig. 2E). That most of the mutations still allowed binding of the dimer to a MyoD site suggested that the MyoD basic domain could tolerate substantial change and/or that a significant contribution to binding was made by the E12 component of the dimer. We thus asked how binding to a MyoD site would be affected if the dimerization partner contained a basic domain for Max, the natural partner for c-Myc. We therefore expressed a chimeric protein (Max/E12) containing the basic domain of Max and the HLH domain of E12. Immunoprecipitations using a polyclonal anti-Max antibody demonstrated that the Max/E12 chimera dimerized equally well with each of the MyoD proteins (Fig. 2F). The ability of MyoD-Max/E12 dimers to bind to the 32P-labeled MyoD site was examined (Fig. 2G). Upon prolonged autoradiographic exposure, the expected low level of DNA binding with wild-type MyoD homodimers was seen. All of the MyoD mutants, in dimeric complex with Max/E12, showed, at best, only trace levels ofbinding that was actually less than that observed with wild-type MyoD homodimers. These data, in conjunction with those shown in Fig. 2C, indicate that the E12 basic domain is a critical determinant of specific DNA binding by MyoD and that its role cannot be duplicated by Max. Binding of MyoD Mutants to a c-Myc Recognition Site. Given our ability to express a MyoD dimerization partner containing either an E12 or a Max DNA-binding domain, we asked whether, in either of these two contexts, mutant MyoD proteins could bind to a consensus c-Myc DNA site. Each MyoD mutant was therefore cotranslated with either E12 or Max/E12 RNA in the presence of nonradioactive methionine and used in an EMSA employing a double-stranded, 32plabeled E0 (GAC) c-Myc binding site (19). Wild-type MyoDE12 dimers were incapable of binding the c-Myc site, as were most of the mutants (Fig. 2H). However, strong binding was noted with mut 9 and mut (7 +9). Thus, mut 7 strongly inhibits MyoD site binding (Fig. 2C) but has no effect on the ability of mut 9 to bind a c-Myc site. Therefore, in association with E12, mut 9 not only allows continued recognition of a MyoD site but unmasks a potent capacity to bind a c-Myc site. When MyoD-Max/E12 dimers were tested by EMSA for binding to a c-Myc site, a similar pattern was seen in that only mut 9 and mut (7+9) bound (Fig. 2I). Overall, the double mutant was significantly better at binding this site, unlike the case for MyoD site binding, where both mutant proteins bound equally well. Expression of MyoD Mutants in Cultured Cells. The MyoD mutants were tested for their abilities to activate musclespecific gene expression. cDNAs in the pRc/CMV expression vector were transfected into C3H/10T1/2 cells along with the p3300MCKCAT reporter plasmid (11). After induction of myogenic differentiation, CAT activity was measured after Biochemistry: Van Antwerp et al. (2) E) (D 9012 Biochemistry: Van Antwerp et al.

(A) Summary of behaviors of MyoD mutants in vitro and in transfected cells. (B) Coimmunoprecipitations of in vitro translated MyoD and E12 proteins. Wild-type (WT) MyoDand MyoD mutants, with or without E12, were transcribed in vitro and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine. One-tenth of each reaction mixture was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal anti-MyoD antibody followed by protein A-agarose beads. Precipitates were resolved by 15% SDS/PAGE and processed for autoradiography. (C) Binding of a consensus MyoD site by MyoD-E12 dimers. MyoD proteins were cotranslated with E12 in the presence of unlabeled methionine. Aliquots were mixed with double-stranded, 32P-end-labeled MyoD oligonucleotide (Oligo) and subjected to EMSA. (D) Inhibition of MyoD oligonucleotide binding by anti-MyoD antibody (Ab). mut 6 and mut 9 were each cotranslated with E12. Standard EMSAs were performed except that 1 jl of either a control antibody or an anti-MyoD antibody was added to the lysate prior to the addition of 32P-labeled MyoD binding site. (E) Competition for MyoD-site binding. Wild-type MyoD and E12 were cotranslated in the presence of unlabeled methionine and then incubated in a standard EMSA mixture with a constant amount of 32P-labeled MyoD oligonucleotide (4) and increasing amounts of either unlabeled (\\\"cold\\\") homologous double-stranded ofigonucleotide or an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a mutant MyoD binding site (CGCCTG). Only the homologous oligonucleotide competed with the labeled probe. (F) Coimmunoprecipitations of MyoD and Max/E12 chimeric proteins. Individual MyoD RNAs were translated in vitro with or without the addition of Max/E12 RNA. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described in B except that a polyclonal anti-Max antibody was used. (G) Lack ofbinding ofMyoD-Max/E12 dimers to a MyoD site. MyoD mutants and Max/E12 chimeric protein were cotranslated as described in C and then tested by EMSA for binding to the end-labeled MyoD oligonucleotide (Oligo). Binding in all cases was significantly less than that observed for wild-type MyoD homodimers (second lane). (H) Binding of MyoD-E12 dimers to a c-Myc site. In vitro translation mixtures from Cwere tested by EMSAfor binding to the EO(GAC) c-Myc binding site. As a comparison for relative degree ofprobe binding, the second lane from the right shows binding of 32P-labeled MyoD binding-site oligonucleotide by cotranslated wild-type plus E12 (see C). Binding ofthe c-Myc site by mut 9-E12 and mut (7+9)-El2 heterodimers was greater than any other binding observed. (I) Binding of MyoD-Max/E12 dimers to a c-Myc site. Binding reactions were as in G except that the EO(GAC) oligonucleotide was used as a probe. appropriate adjustments for transfection efficiencies. Based on CAT enzyme assays and in vitro DNA-binding profiles, three types of mutations were observed: (i) those with only minimal effects on both MyoD-site binding and MCK promoter activation (mut 1, mut 3, and mut 8); (ii) those with markedly reduced DNA binding and transcriptional activation potential [mut 7 and mut (7+9)]; and (iii) those with normal or increased DNA binding but impaired MCK proa _ dbwu* 4 7 Af F G~~~~~~~~~, -,-at H Mvo D 4 i. .AL. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 89 (1992) 4 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992) 9013 moter activation [mut 6 and mut (1-4)]. As expected from the in vitro DNA binding profiles, transcriptional activation of the MCK promoter was also greatly impaired with all MyoD constructs when they were cotransfected with a Max/E12 expression vector (data not shown). The low level of activation that was observed in some cases was most likely the result of functional dimerization between transfected MyoD proteins and endogenous E12 or E47 proteins. The myogenic capacity of each of the mutants was further tested by measuring the ability of transfected C3H/10T1/2 cells to express myosin heavy chains. The results (Fig. 2A) were in general agreement with those obtained by transient assays with the MCK-CAT reporter plasmid. The ability to bind DNA but not to activate target-gene expression suggested that mut 9 would compete with wildtype MyoD for MCK promoter activation, thus serving as a type of dominant negative mutant. We tested this directly in cotransfection experiments using constant amounts of the pRcCMV/wtMyoD expression plasmid and p3300MCKCAT reporter plasmid and varying amounts of pRcCMV/mut 9 (Fig. 3). As the amount of this latter plasmid DNA increased, CAT activity in cellular extracts progressively declined, eventually reaching background levels. That competition with wild-type MyoD was virtually complete with only a 2-fold molar excess of mut 9 suggested either that binding of the mutant protein to the MyoD site was extremely efficient or that it effectively competed for a limiting partner (e.g., E12) in the C3H/10T1/2 cells. The adenovirus MLP contains a consensus c-Myc site at positions -63 to -52 relative to the start of transcription. The bHLH protein USF also binds to this site and results in a 10- to 20-fold enhancement of transcription in an in vitro assay with other critical transcription factors (28). Using an MLPCAT vector (pMLP-CAT), we asked how c-Myc and several 3 .2 'U 1) Competitor plasmid, ,ug FIG. 3. mut 9 protein competes with wild-type MyoD for binding to and activation of the MCK promoter. C3H/1OTh/2 cells were transfected with 5 Ag of p3300MCK-CAT and 20 ,ug of pRcCMV/ wtMyoD plus the indicated amount of either pRcCMV/mut 9 (filled bars) or additional pRcCMV/wtMyoD as a control (hatched bars). Differences in DNA concentrations were adjusted with pRcCMV vector DNA. Myogenic differentiation was induced and CAT enzyme determinations were performed 2 days later on extracts from pooled, duplicate plates after adjusting for differences in transfection efficiencies.

C3H/10T\\u00bd2 cells were transfected with pMLP-CAT DNA and the pRcCMV expression vector alone or containing c-Myc, wild-type MyoD, mut 7, or mut 9 cDNAs. Neither wild-type MyoD nor mut 7 had any significant effect on CAT levels (Fig. 4). However, the expression of both c-Myc and mut 9 caused a consistent 4- to 6-fold suppression of CAT activity. These results, together with those in Fig. 2, demonstrate that the mut 9 mutation expands the DNA-binding specificity of MyoD to include the c-Myc site, causes it to lose the ability to activate genes containing MyoD sites, and imbues it with the ability to regulate a gene containing a c-Myc binding site in a manner indistinguishable from that seen with authentic c-Myc. DISCUSSION Previous analyses of bHLH proteins have begun to elucidate the contribution of the basic domains to specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Thus, replacement of the MyoD basic domain with that from E12 abolishes transcriptional activation without affecting DNA binding, indicating that these are distinct and separable functions (4). In the related bHLH protein myogenin, Ala6 and Thr87, two amino acids highly conserved among all myogenic proteins described to date, and corresponding to positions 4 and 5 of c-Myc and MyoD (Fig. 1), are essential for muscle-specific transcription (6). In the E47 bHLH protein, two arginine residues, flanking position 8 in the aligned sequences shown in Fig. 1, are necessary for DNA binding (5). Finally, a chimeric gene containing the c-Myc basic domain embedded in the yeast CBFJ gene can rescue a cbfl null mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from methionine auxotrophy whereas a similar gene containing an AP4 basic domain cannot (29). The difference in biological function between these two basic domains maps to a single amino acid correBiochemistry: Van Antwerp et al. 9014 Biochemistry: Van Antwerp et al. sponding to position 9 (Fig. 1). In c-Myc this position is the main determinant for recognition of the variant inner dinucleotide in the CANNTG motif (30). We have identified four distinct classes of MyoD mutants: (i) those with no or minimal effects on MyoD-site binding and transcriptional activation (mut 1, mut 3, and mut 8; Fig. 1), (ii) those with markedly reduced binding and transcriptional activation activity [mut 7 and mut (7+9)], (iii) those with normal or even increased DNA binding but reduced transcriptional activation [mut 6 and mut (1-4)], and (iv) one with reduced MyoD-site binding and transcriptional activation but with markedly enhanced binding to a c-Myc site (mut 9). Leu122 in the MyoD basic domain is thus a major determinant of DNA binding specificity and is likely to play a key role in recognizing the inner dinucleotide sequence within the CANNTG motif. These results provide a rationale for the highly conserved nature of the position 9 residue among all bHLH myogenic proteins (including E12 and E47), where it is always a leucine or valine, and among all proteins of the Myc/Max family, where it is always an arginine. It is significant that mut 9, even when dimerized with Max/E12, altered DNA binding specificity to such an extent that it permitted the recognition of a c-Myc site. That such dimers also allow binding to a MyoD site suggests that, rather than changing DNA-binding specificity, the effect ofmutation is to expand the subset of dinucleotides within the CANNTG motif that can be recognized by MyoD. Although c-Myc is related to other transcriptional activators of the bHLH family and contains a transactivation domain (31), we found that c-Myc, rather than inducing a MLP-CAT construct, actually caused a suppression, a property that has been described in the case of three collagen genes (32). More important, whereas neither wild-type nor mut 7 MyoD affected MLP-CAT expression, mut 9 produced a suppressive effect indistinguishable from that of c-Myc. These results, together with those in Fig. 2, indicate that, at least in some contexts, mut 9 protein can functionally substitute for c-Myc. That mutation of Leu122 to Arg in MyoD can occur as a result of a single nucleotide substitution (CTG -* CGG) suggests a mechanism for skeletal muscle oncogenesis. During terminal differentiation, which requires withdrawal from the cell cycle (33), myoblasts cease to express c-Myc (34, 35) and will fail to differentiate if the expression of this protein persists (36-39). A MyoD protein with the position 9 (Leu122 - Arg) mutation might, however, be able to functionally substitute for c-Myc as the expression of the c-myc gene is extinguished, thus providing a sustained proliferative signal. This might also occur through other myogenic proteins (40-43) that contain this conserved position 9 leucine. The MyoD gene is also under positive autoregulatory control (44), and its continued expression is required to maintain the differentiated state (45) and perhaps also to aid in the induction of quiescence during terminal myogenic differentiation (27, 46). Because mut 9 is transcriptionally inactive toward muscle-specific genes, it or similar mutations might also compete with wild-type MyoD to suppress the expression of myogenic proteins and to stimulate proliferation through c-Myc-independent pathways.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Cleanup Raw Text  "],"metadata":{"id":"TbtYS2Tl4YF6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n","from wordcloud import STOPWORDS, WordCloud"],"metadata":{"id":"OwWMFQC-tK58","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728357638243,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Aupu_AI","userId":"12893461163900296745"}}},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stop_words = set(STOPWORDS)\n","\n","def clean_text(total_text, index, column):\n","  if type(total_text) is not int:\n","    text = ''\n","\n","    # replace every special char with space\n","    total_text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9\\n]', ' ', total_text)\n","\n","    # replace multiple spaces with single space\n","    total_text = re.sub('\\s+', ' ', total_text)\n","\n","    # converting all the chars into lower-case.\n","    total_text = total_text.lower()\n","\n","    # Combining all the above sentence\n","\n","    from tqdm import tqdm\n","    # tqdm is for printing the status bar\n","\n","    for word in tqdm(total_text.split()):\n","    # if the word is a not a stop word then retain that word from the data\n","      if not word in stop_words:\n","        text += word + ' '\n","\n","    text_df[column][index] = text\n","\n","    from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n","    porter = PorterStemmer()\n","    list_of_sentence=[]\n","    for  sentence in total_text:\n","        words_in_sentence=[]\n","        for words in sentence.split():\n","            words_in_sentence.append(porter.stem(words))\n","\n","        list_of_sentence.append(' '.join(words_in_sentence))\n","    return(list_of_sentence)"],"metadata":{"id":"-AeT-QF55FXs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728357638243,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Aupu_AI","userId":"12893461163900296745"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Preprocess text"],"metadata":{"id":"5jOruYFzGhTH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for index, row in text_df.iterrows():\n","  if type(row['TEXT']) is str:\n","    clean_text(row['TEXT'], index, 'TEXT')\n","  else:\n","    print('There is no text description for ID: ', index)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"id":"8GRoIF2JG7VD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728358178822,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":540597,"user":{"displayName":"Aupu_AI","userId":"12893461163900296745"}},"outputId":"8229e28e-769e-4067-e431-9d46d7267135"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\u001b[1;30;43mStreaming output truncated to the last 5000 lines.\u001b[0m\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  text_df[column][index] = text\n","100%|██████████| 4649/4649 [00:00<00:00, 772464.42it/s]\n","<ipython-input-6-69a3375a3258>:26: FutureWarning: ChainedAssignmentError: behaviour will change in pandas 3.0!\n","You are setting values through chained assignment.
